Character is mentioned:
TEXT_AKTKBB101_04067_LALAHJINJAHL_000_025 -- Their leader, a Viera male, is also alleged to have stolen valuable technological secrets.

TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_SEQ_03 -- As you scan your surrounds, you chance to hear a cry for help. Together with Lalah, you rush towards the disturbance to find a man at the mercy of three assailants. Your intervention prompts the villainsâ”€a Viera man named Loifa and his two accomplicesâ”€to leave, and you turn to render aid to their intended victim.

TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_LOIFA_100_023 -- (-Angry Viera-)Look at me...

TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_LOIFA_100_024 -- (-Angry Viera-)...When I'm talking to you!

TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_LALAHJINJAHL_100_038 -- A sage besides! Speaking of which, one of your assailantsâ”€the Viera manâ”€also wielded sage magic. Was he known to you?

TEXT_AKTKBB121_04070_SEQ_03 -- You arrive to find Loifa and the merchant lying in the dirt, the latter having breathed his last. Though Loifa may still be saved, Lalah hesitatesâ”€for it was her mother who died at the hands of his accomplice. At your words, however, she recognizes that there can be no justice without knowing the whole truth, and bids you render aid to the ailing Viera.

TEXT_AKTKBB131_04071_SEQ_06 -- Given the seriousness of the hunter's wound, Loifa decides it is no time for training, and personally renders aid. Once back on his feet, the man offers Loifa his heartfelt gratitudeâ”€an act which spurs the young Viera to reflect upon his sage's power. Before meeting you and Lalah, he had no purpose for it except revenge.

Her hatred festering within her, Ondine sought the cooperation of local highwaymen, and even hired them to assassinate Editha on the road through the Shroud.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_600 -- Ah, yes. I have learned much of the leporine folk during my travels, so let us start off with the most basic of detailsâ”€there exist two distinct clans, the light-skinned Veena Viera, and the darker-skinned Rava Viera.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_601 -- The word Viera itself means â€œpeople of the wood,â€� and true to that name, both the Rava and the Veena make their homes exclusively in the Golmore Jungle, or the primeval forests which line the southwestern foothills of the Skatay Range, respectively.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_602 -- Until recentlyâ”€perhaps the past several generationsâ”€a Viera living outside her homeland was unheard of, and those who abandoned their tribes were branded outcasts.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_603 -- You see, the Viera follow a strict code called the â€œGreen Wordâ€� that binds them to their land and prohibits all contact with the outside world unless absolutely necessary.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_604 -- Similar to that of the Miqo'te Keepers of the Moon, the Viera's societal hierarchy is strictly matriarchal. You will find no males in the villages of both the Veena and the Rava, let alone in positions of rule.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_605 -- Yet, that does not mean they do not play an important role in Viera society. The males take up the mantle of Wood-warderâ”€protectors of the forestâ”€and serve their tribes by seeing no evil encroach on their tribe's sacred demesne.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_607 -- In other words, tread not the wood with hopes of finding a male Viera, for you will be met with naught but disappointment...or worse, death.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_608 -- This, however, is not to discredit the martial prowess of female Viera. The women of the wood are as formidable as the men, and merely choose to devote their attention to the protection of their hearth and young.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_610 -- I spent many a moon in the Desert Sapphire, and while I saw all manner of wondrous creatures, not once did I lay mine eyes upon a male Viera, nor did I hear of one living in the city. They simply do not exist to us.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_620 -- For the Viera, the hands of time move at a far more leisurely pace than they do for the rest of us. Whereas a Hyur might consider themselves fortunate to see, say, eighty winters before <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> return to the Lifestream, a Viera can endure up to twelve score or more.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_621 -- It is estimated that upwards of eight in ten Viera are born female, though it is not until at least the thirteenth namedayâ”€when the individual moves from adolescence into adulthoodâ”€that the individual's gender becomes apparent.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_622 -- Then, for the next two centuries will the Viera maintain its physical youth, rendering it nigh impossible to discern one's age simply from outward appearances.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_623 -- When it is revealed that a Viera kit is a male, it will be given into the care of another, that it may learn the ways of the Wood-warderâ”€protectors of the forest.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_624 -- Once every three to five summers, male Viera will descend from the trees to a nearby village to mate.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_628 -- As I explained before, the duty of a male Vieraâ”€a Wood-warderâ”€is to see that their tribe's demesne remain untouched by the destructive whims of outsiders. Yet, they do so from the shadows, oft choosing to shoot first, and not even bother with questions.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_630 -- Efforts by past kings to bring Viera lands under Dalmascan rule have been met with either indifference or violence. As of late, Rabanastre has suffered the Viera their self-governance, with the promise the villages will not take up their bows against the throne.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_631 -- When I was younger and far more the fool than I am now, I asked a Viera if she did not find her tribe's ways awkward. Was it not within the natural order for males and females of a species to coexist?

TEXT_REGHINCOMPANYMENMBERS2V43_00494_BEWITCHINGMEMBER_000_250 -- The Viera possess a beauty that cannot be matched by other races. Yet how they stalk the jungle in those stilettos, perhaps we will never know.

TEXT_REGHINCOMPANYMENMBERS3V45_00542_GOODLOOKINGMEMBER_000_050 -- You spoke with a Viera, you say? How exotic! I recall reading that following the Empire's occupation of Dalmasca, several imperial army units were sent into the jungles to round up the hares and bring them to Rabanastre.

TEXT_REGHINCOMPANYMENMBERS3V45_00542_GOODLOOKINGMEMBER_000_051 -- As you might imagine, only a few of the soldiers returned...and the few Viera with them appeared to have followed on their own volition.

TEXT_REGHINCOMPANYMENMBERS3V45_00542_GOODLOOKINGMEMBER_000_052 -- Those Viera who have taken up residence in the cities tend to be held in high regard, their small numbers lending to their air of mystery. It is not unheard of for members of the upper class to part with great deals of their wealth simply to be seen with one of the elusive ladies.

TEXT_REGHINCOMPANYMENMBERS3V45_00542_PERFORMANCEMEMBER_000_053 -- This all must be especially difficult for the Viera. Despite their differences in culture and appearance, they had long been accepted by the Dalmascansâ”€treated as equals. Now...

TEXT_REGHINRETURNTOIVALICESTORYNPC002_00543_JENOMIS_500_006 -- Still, many Viera continue their adherence to a strict code that has governed their people since ere the age of Ivaliceâ”€none may enter their jungle, and none may leave.

TEXT_REGHINRETURNTOIVALICESTORYNPC002_00543_JENOMIS_500_007 -- To the Viera, Golmore is sacred ground, and they will not suffer what they view as the desecration of their sovereign domain by outsiders. This is especially true for those who would dare hunt their lands.

TEXT_STMBDI301_03187_MONTBLANC_000_180 -- Why, certainly! That verdant valley of vines and vipers to where we must voyage next is home to the Vieraâ”€and therein lies our little problem. The one thing the Viera do not suffer is trespassers, not even lovable moogles, kupo!

TEXT_STMBDI301_03187_HURDY_000_181 -- Our glamours kept us hidden long enough to see the jungle was teeming with ruins much like those we've discovered in Lesalia and Goug, but the Viera trackers eventually found us and took us before their elders. We barely escaped with our poms, kupo!

TEXT_STMBDI301_03187_JENOMISLEXENTALE_000_183 -- There are Viera who have spurned the strict code of their tribes, abandoning their people to come and live in the cities of Dalmasca.
