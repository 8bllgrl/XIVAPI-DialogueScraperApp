TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_A1_000_005 -- Who are you and what is a dramaturge?

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_A1_000_001 -- The Wandering Dramaturge.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_A3_000_005 -- Who are you and what is a dramaturge?

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_100 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)Jenomis had been at the Magitek Academy for but a handful of summers when he founded his own theater troupe, and it was but a handful more before his plays began attracting recognition in various influential literary circles.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_101 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)Although Jenomis is not a prolific writer, what he lacks in quantity he makes up tenfold in quality. The public especially adored the few pieces he both produced and starred in. So popular were his troupe's productions that admirers would have to book their seats a year or more in advance.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_102 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)And though he was widely regarded as one of the finest playwrights in the Empire, none was more surprised than Jenomis himself when Emperor Solus zos Galvus, in recognition of the young principal's accomplishments, presented him with his very own airship.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_103 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)This has since become a source of considerable ire for the new emperor, but I think Jenomis would have it no other way. You see, where his art is concerned, Jenomis will not compromise. He will write and rewrite and then rewrite again until he has achieved what he believes to be perfection.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_104 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)He will create something so perfect that even his greatest detractor will be forced to acknowledge its genius. Critics applaud Jenomis for his cunning, but I know it to be merely a by-product of his inherent stubbornness. Jenomis simply cannotâ”€will notâ”€settle for anything less than the best.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_120 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)Since its inception during Jenomis's Academy days, the Majestic Theater Company has been busily producing and performing some of the Empire's most memorable works.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_121 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)From tragedies to comedies, classics to modern adaptations, monodrama to musicals, there was nothing the Majestic couldn't doâ”€and do brilliantly.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_122 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)At the time of <Emphasis>The Zodiac Brave Story</Emphasis>'s debut, the theater was home to over five score performers and stagehands, all living here on the <Emphasis>Prima Vista</Emphasis>. Now... Well, you can see where we stand.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_140 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)The Zodiac Brave Story is a tale as old as time.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_141 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)Whenever the kingdom was threatened, be it by tyranny, evil forces, or realm-wide disaster, twelve blessed heroes would emerge to bring light back to Ivalice. Those twelve were known as the Zodiac Braves.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_142 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)Each era had its own Zodiac Bravesâ”€MÃ¼llenkamp the star seer, Saint Ajora, the assassin Ashley. I can list at least five others, but by far the most popular has always been King Delita.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_143 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)Following the death of its king, Ivalice's long-standing Atkascha dynasty finds itself without an heir. In an attempt to claim the throne, the Order of the Northern Sky under the banner of the White Lion and the Order of the Southern Sky under the Black Lion wage war, resulting in the death of thousands and a veritable stalemate.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_144 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)When all of Ivalice was at war with itself, he and eleven of his most trusted companions set out to bring order to the realm. Though not of noble birth, Delita would ultimately unite the land as regent, and the twelve became known as that era's Zodiac Braves.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_145 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)There has been much debate as to whether the legend is based on actual historical events or merely fiction, but most scholars agree that there is simply too little evidence to substantiate claims of Ivalice's existence.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_146 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)There are no ruins, there are no relics. And the stories we are left with...well, they are just thatâ”€stories. What's worse, there are so many of them, each with its own peculiarities, that only the most basic elements actually line up.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_147 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)Even some of the more recent renderings of the legend feature dramatic deviations, the most notable being that Delita was assassinated before even taking the throne, instead of becoming king after his marriage to Princess Ovelia Atkascha.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_148 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)But that has always been the trouble with bards and minstrels. You can't trust a single one of them not to change the story here or there for the sake of a rhyme.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_149 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)And so here we are, left in the dark without a light to ponder a mystery only the gods know. Not that I believe in gods, mind you.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_160 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)Unsurprisingly there are many plays which attempt a telling of the Zodiac Brave Story, but none have been as well received as the Majestic's rendition.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_161 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)When Jenomis told me he was considering his own retelling of the legend, I was not remotely surprised. When he subsequently revealed his intention to make it a musical, however, I nearly spat out my mead.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_162 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)Not content simply to write the play, he composed the music, penned the lyrics, and even saw to the damned <Emphasis>choreography</Emphasis>. I had never seen anything like it. With the completion of <Emphasis>The Zodiac Brave Story</Emphasis>, he proved his genius once and for all.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_163 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)The musical is divided into five acts, the first three focusing on Delita's service to the Church of Glabados, his first encounter with Princess Ovelia Atkascha, and his subsequent oath to see her become queen.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_164 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)The final two acts move to the War of the Lions, culminating in Delita's betrothal to the princess, and their tragic end.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_165 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)The ensemble scene in which Delita, lost in his web of lies, reveals the truth of his plans to the gods on one side of the stage, while on the other, Princess Ovelia swears to the selfsame gods that she will put the past behind her... <Emphasis>Genius.</Emphasis> A masterpiece of modern theater.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_180 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)The Dalmasca Desert is a vast wasteland situated in the southern reaches of central Othard, sharing an eastern border with Nagxia. So large is the desert that it is divided into two regions, the Estersands and the Westersands.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_181 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)Thirty years ago, the kingdom of Dalmasca was invaded by the Garlean Empire. When the king and his council refused to pledge fealty to the Empire, war erupted, resulting in the end of the royal B'nargin line.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_182 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)For a thousand years, Dalmasca had maintained its independence, only to see it crumble in a matter of moons before the might of Solus zos Galvus's metal-clad legions. Even the Royal City of Rabanastreâ”€the fabled Desert Sapphireâ”€was not spared.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_183 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)Emboldened by the uprisings in Doma and Ala Mhigo, resistance groups within Dalmasca have attempted coups of their own, yet all have been silencedâ”€the Empire always seeming to know exactly when and where the insurgencies would begin.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_184 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)When I was a boy, I accompanied my father on one of his caravans to Rabanastre, and consider myself fortunate to have seen the Royal City before its fall. The sight of its minarets bathed in the gold of sunset is something I will never forget.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_200 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)Who am I? A simple question with a not-so-simple answer. I can begin by telling you who I am not: namely, a member of the Majestic Theater Company.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_201 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)I am a playwright like Principal Lexentale, but unlike him, I have chosen to remain independent. Jenomis is an old friend, and when I heard he would be making the journey east, I asked if I could join him. You see, I too share many of the ideals that have fallen out of favor in the imperial court.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_202 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)As for who is the better writer...well, it is not for me to say. I will, however, admit to being a considerably <Emphasis>slower</Emphasis> writer, as my publishers will all too readily attest. To make matters worse, I have also developed a passion for cookery of late, and spend a great deal of my time here assisting the galley staff in exchange for my passage on the <Emphasis>Prima Vista</Emphasis>. Perhaps a change of profession is in order...

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_220 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)The minstrel? With the disheveled hair? As strange a fish as any I've seen...and I have seen plenty on my travels.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_221 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)Most bards simply retell the tales of high adventure, adding a twang of the lute here and a toot of the fife there for flavor. But the wandering minstrel is different. He seems more inclined to challenge his audience than entertain them.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_00491_ALLAGAN_000_222 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)One might say he is a god creating worlds for his children to play in. Or not. A god would never be caught wearing those spectacles. Still, there is much a playwright like myself might learn from such a fellow...

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_A10_000_001 -- The Wandering Dramaturge.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_ALLAGAN_000_300 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)It has been almost thirty summers since the Empire's conquest of Dalmascaâ”€the annexation coming some years before the invasions of both Ala Mhigo and Doma.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_ALLAGAN_000_301 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)The campaign was led by Legatus Noah van Gabranth of the IVth Imperial Legion, and waged over six bloody moons.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_ALLAGAN_000_302 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)It was the fall of the supposedly impenetrable stronghold at Nalbina, with the loss of some seventy thousand Dalmascan swords, that ultimately turned the tide in the Empire's favor.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_ALLAGAN_000_303 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)When it was discovered that the list of casualties included both Prince Rasler and his twin sister Princess Ashelia, all fight left the embattled regent and he soon thereafter conceded the crown.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_ALLAGAN_000_304 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)He passed not long after his surrender, and while the official explanation was that he succumbed to illness, rumors of suicide and even assassination persist to this day. What is certain, however, is that with his death, the B'nargin lineâ”€one that had endured for a thousand summersâ”€finally came to an end.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_ALLAGAN_000_320 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)The Dalmascans took to their new rulers about as well as one might expect, and in the years since the annexation, several sizable uprisings have caught flame, only to be quelled by the Empire's might.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_ALLAGAN_000_321 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)That does not, however, mean we Garleans have emerged from these bouts of insurrection unscathed. One recent example is the Barheim Incident, in which scores of imperial colonists met their end.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_ALLAGAN_000_322 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)In response to this rather arbitrary display of defiance, the Emperor sent the XIVth Legion back to Dalmasca, where, under the watch of Livia sas Junius, suspected rebels were hunted down like rats and slaughtered without trial.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_ALLAGAN_000_323 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)Of course, this served only to embolden the resistance. Yet, the ending of their tale was not as happy as those told in Doma and Ala Mhigo...as you will have gleaned from your recent visit to Rabanastre.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_ALLAGAN_000_324 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)Which is not to say the resistance is no more. If anything, it grows stronger, its members biding their time deep in the endless labyrinth that lies beneath the capital.

TEXT_REGHINALLAGANSTORAGESYSTEM_00491_ALLAGAN_000_325 -- (-The Wandering Dramaturge-)I have even heard it whispered that they are now rallied under a new leaderâ”€a charismatic young firebrand the people call â€œPrincess Ashe.â€� What? Of course it cannot be the <Emphasis>real</Emphasis> Ashelia. Even had she survived the tragedy at Nalbina, Her Highness would by now have seen nigh on fifty summers!

TEXT_REGHINCOMPANYMENMBERS2V43_00494_BEWITCHINGMEMBER_000_112 -- ...I was torn. I longed to console Jenomis in his time of grief, but I was afraid that I would somehow be betraying my friend in so doingâ”€afraid of what my heart might see me do. If it were not for yon dramaturge, I would surely have done something I would have lived to regret. He is my reason for being. The reason I am here.

TEXT_REGHINRETURNTOIVALICESTORYNPC001_00495_LINA_000_040 -- I may or may not have overheard our friend the dramaturge utter the word â€œfetchâ€� a time or three during your last conversation. Don't let it discourage you. I know these tasks would be far from simple were it not for the trust you have fostered with the people of some half-dozen nations.

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_SEQ_00 -- The wandering dramaturge has something to ask of you.

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_SEQ_01 -- Taking full advantage of the loose end at which you find yourself, the Majestic's self-proclaimed â€œwandering dramaturgeâ€� has requested your aid in fetchingâ”€ahem, <Emphasis>procuring</Emphasis> him a bottle of wine, preferably rose-themed.

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_SEQ_12 -- Upon delivering the finely fermented fruits of your labor to the wandering dramaturge, he tells you it is, in fact, a gift for his wifeâ”€none other than the company belleâ”€to celebrate the day the two first met.

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_SEQ_13 -- Satisfied with your effort, the dramaturge offers you both his thanks and a little something for your trouble.

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_TODO_10 -- Deliver the bottle of Suhd Viandja to the wandering dramaturge on the <Emphasis>Prima Vista</Emphasis>.

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_TODO_11 -- Speak with the wandering dramaturge.

TEXT_STMBDI211_03093_SEQ_01 -- Relief washes over you as your conversation with the company belle ends without a single mention of bacon bread. According to the wandering dramaturge's scantily clad soul mate, the good man would simply like to learn more of your exploits at the Ridorana Cataract.

TEXT_STMBDI211_03093_SEQ_02 -- The dramaturge is somehow able to turn a congratulatory toast to your recent victory over the forces of darkness into a request to fetch him ten loaves ofâ”€you guessed itâ”€bacon bread of the highest quality.

TEXT_STMBDI211_03093_SEQ_03 -- Ever impressed by your resourcefulness, the dramaturge rewards you with a pair of rare trinkets which may well be worth far more than he realizes. Not that you should feel any compunction to tell him...

TEXT_STMBDI211_03093_TODO_00 -- Speak with the wandering dramaturge.

TEXT_STMBDI211_03093_TODO_01 -- Deliver loaves of bacon bread <Sheet(Addon,9,0)/> to the wandering dramaturge.

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_SEQ_00 -- The wandering dramaturge wishes to express his appreciation.

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_SEQ_01 -- The wandering dramaturge wishes to express his appreciation...for the wine you brought him, more so than the effort it took to acquire it.

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_SEQ_02 -- It turns out the wine you bent over backwards to procure for the wandering dramaturge was only about as expensive as an afternoon in the Gold Saucer's Round Square. To apologize, Hancockâ”€who has seemingly appeared out of nowhereâ”€presents you with not one, not two, but three bottles of Dalmascan red he purchased from the Dalmascan resistance group, Lente's Tears. Now, you have the opportunity to replace the counterfeit bottle with which you tricked Master Gegeruju of Costa del Sol.

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_SEQ_03 -- The wandering dramaturge suggests that you employ the aid of Shamani Lohmani in your latest attempt to pull the proverbial wool over Master Gegeruju's eyes.

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_SEQ_07 -- Amazingly, the wandering dramaturge offers what, in some circles, might be considered an apology for having you straddle the Three Great Continents on his behalf. The end...?

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_TODO_00 -- Speak with the wandering dramaturge.

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_TODO_01 -- Speak with the wandering dramaturge.

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_TODO_05 -- Return to the <Emphasis>Prima Vista</Emphasis> and speak with the wandering dramaturge.

TEXT_STMBDI312_03191_SEQ_01 -- The wandering dramaturge cannot bear to drink his rice wine without the proper local refreshmentsâ”€grilled turbans, tempura, and tako-yakiâ”€and he will only accept those of the absolute <Emphasis>highest quality</Emphasis>.

TEXT_STMBDI312_03191_SEQ_02 -- The wandering dramaturge is satisfied with your noble effort to deliver him refreshments. He hands you your reward and asks you to leave swiftly and quietly so that he may enjoy his supper.

TEXT_STMBDI312_03191_TODO_00 -- Deliver three grilled turbans <Sheet(Addon,9,0)/>, three tempura platters <Sheet(Addon,9,0)/>, and three servings of tako-yaki <Sheet(Addon,9,0)/> to the wandering dramaturge.
