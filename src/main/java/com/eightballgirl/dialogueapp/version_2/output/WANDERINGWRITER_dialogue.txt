Though I suppose that's only right, considering I followed you. My well of inspiration has run dry, you see, and it is my hope that a change of scenery might offer the impetus my work requires.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_000_001 -- And time again you have proven a knack for finding fascinating locales, with equally fascinating stories unfolding soon after. 

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_100_000 -- When such a tale finally <Emphasis>does</Emphasis> unfold, I should very much like to hear it. 

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_100_050 -- If you've no epic tales to share, perhaps I can regale you with a story of my own.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_Q1_000_000 -- What will you do?

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_A100_000_000 -- Ask to hear a story.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_A1_000_000 -- Nothing.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_Q2_000_100 -- What will you ask about?

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_A1_000_100 -- The holy blade, Save the Queen.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_000 -- Battle fought in the mind of a dear companion? How thrilling, how compelling! Please, tell me more.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_001 -- A specter of the late Emperor Varis. I suppose even a figment of one's memory, assuming sufficient creative liberties are taken, can prove as fearsome as a man of flesh and blood.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_002 -- Admittedly, I cannot claim to have witnessed his prowess firsthand, but who has not heard tales of his savagery, his unparalleled might?

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_003 -- Yes, I do believe inspiration has struck, my friend. The brutal battle of words which proceeded a nightmarish clash 'twixt the Emperor and the realm's great liberator.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_004 -- â€œYou would dare approach me thus?â€� Lord Varis scoffed. â€œWhere men of greater strength and mind both would flee, you dare commit to such folly?â€�

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_005 -- To which the liberator coolly replied, â€œHow else am I to smite thee save...erm...approaching...â€�

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_006 -- An admirable attempt, if I were still learning my letters perhaps. It seems my prose yet wants for inspiration.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_500_007 -- Might you humor me with a more detailed account of your confrontation? I require a more vivid picture if I am to do justice to your deeds.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_SYSTEM_500_008 -- Idols earned in Memoria Misera (Extreme) can be exchanged for gear and other items by speaking with C'intana in Revenant's Toll.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_000 -- Gunnhildr's Blades were possessed of not one but myriad weapons with which they saved their queen. Oh, to see the look on the Resistance soldiers' faces when Gerolt's work is complete.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_001 -- Wait. Save the Queen? Why do those words sound so familiar... Yes, of course! Queen Gunnhildr was said to wield a holy blade bearing that name. A rather nonsensical moniker, if I may be so bold, but perhaps in ancient tongues it held some sense of grandeur.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_002 -- That Bozjans still speak of her reign with such reverence is testament to their storytelling traditions. Traditions which may very well serve to rekindle the flames of this playwright's spirit.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_003 -- Which is to say, there is little I know of the blade save for its name. When I at last find time to sit down and learn all there is to know of the queen and her gallant guard, I shall regale you with a tale unlike any you have heard before.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_010 -- Ah, yes. The legendary blade, Save the Queen. I happened upon a most fascinating book on its history not long ago.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_011 -- It is said this blade, blessed by the gods, could only be wielded by she who would become queen of Bozja. As such, it was passed down through the ages, along with the title of Queen Gunnhildr, serving as undeniable proof of her sovereignty.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_012 -- A passage I'm certain you have heard repeated ad nauseam. What I read next, however, was a captivating account of how the queen single-handedly saved her people from certain destruction. 

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_013 -- The Fourth Umbral Calamity had come in the form of a great and terrible earthquake. The Allagan Empire quickly met its destruction, the earth rising up to swallow it whole. Alas, the destruction would not end with the fall of a single nation.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_014 -- The lands were ablaze with flame, the heavens marred with hues of bloody crimson. Death had come for the people of Bozja, and indeed would claim most as they fled to sanctuary within the castle.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_015 -- All hope seemed lost... It was then Queen Gunnhildr proclaimed that, if what remained of their home would be saved, the full might of Save the Queen must be brought to bear. A proclamation met with inconsolable tears and lamentations, for her people understood the meaning in it.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_016 -- Taking her blade firmly in hand, the queen quickly thrust it into her breast. Queen Gunnhildr was no more, but in her place stood a goddess, for Save the Queen had taken her body as its vessel.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_017 -- Her first and final act was to expend every onze of her strength to erect a barrier surrounding what few survivors of Bozja remained.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_018 -- The magick held true, but when the barrier fell, naught remained but lifeless, desolate landscape. Their only solace being the threat of the Fourth Umbral Calamity had passed.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_019 -- In time, the land would heal. Green found its way back to the soil, rainwater replenishing streams and rivers. Life soon followed.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_020 -- All that remained of Bozja was the castle, battered yet unbroken. A monument to Queen Gunnhildr's sacrifice.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_021 -- Thus ended the reign of Queen Gunnhildr. Though she and her holy blade were no more, they would live on in the memory of her people.

TEXT_CTSOPN52WANDERINGWRITER_00667_WANDERINGWRITER_600_022 -- Touching, is it not? A tale fit for the stage if I ever heard one. Would that I had the time to pen works worthy of her legacy.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_WANDERINGWRITER_000_310 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! My, my, that I should find you here of all places. Though I suppose that's only right, considering I followed you. My well of inspiration has run dry, you see, and it is my hope that a change of scenery might offer the impetus my work requires.

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_WANDERINGWRITER_000_311 -- And time and again you have proven a knack for finding fascinating locales, with equally fascinating stories unfolding soon thereafter. 

TEXT_LUCKSA003_03836_WANDERINGWRITER_000_312 -- When such a tantalizing tale finally <Emphasis>does</Emphasis> unfold, I should very much like to hear it. 

TEXT_LUCKSA211_04027_WANDERINGWRITER_000_001 -- And for that you have my sympathies, but genius is a most fickle mistress, and her expertise was thoroughly spent but recently on a playscript promised to my dear friend Jenomis.

TEXT_LUCKSA211_04027_WANDERINGWRITER_000_003 -- Compensation...? That drink was meant to be payment for my services!?

TEXT_LUCKSA211_04027_WANDERINGWRITER_000_005 -- As I recall, you and your wife were the ones who drank most of it. And you clearly have more money than sense, because that particular â€œvintageâ€� was positively revolting.

TEXT_LUCKSA211_04027_WANDERINGWRITER_000_008 -- Thus do I find myself wanting for inspiration. Have you, by chance, embarked on any fantastical journeys of late? Grand adventures to stir the soul and perhaps my writing hand to commit pen to paper?

TEXT_LUCKSA211_04027_WANDERINGWRITER_000_009 -- The fabled blade Save the Queen given life, guarded by Gunnhildr's Blades... And you say this took place in the ruins of the Bozjan royal palace? My oh my, that is quite the riveting tale.

TEXT_LUCKSA211_04027_WANDERINGWRITER_000_011 -- You are quite right, my friend. The seed of inspiration has been planted. <If(PlayerParameter(4))>She<Else/>He</If> stands in the royal palaceâ”€no, the royal cathedral! A suitably opulent location, at any rate. And the last descendant of Queen Gunnhildr stands ready to defy you in pursuit of her lifelong ambition!

TEXT_LUCKSA211_04027_WANDERINGWRITER_000_012 -- â€œWhy do you insist on standing in my way!?â€� she exclaimed, tightening her grip on the holy blade. â€œAre you truly so eager to meet your gods?â€�

TEXT_LUCKSA211_04027_WANDERINGWRITER_000_013 -- â€œNo! Any who would oppose me are undeserving of such a mercy! The only solace you shall have from my wrath will be damnation!â€�

TEXT_LUCKSA211_04027_WANDERINGWRITER_000_014 -- ...No. No, I fear having not seen the exchange firsthand, my prose will stray too far into the realm of fiction.

TEXT_LUCKSA211_04027_WANDERINGWRITER_000_015 -- If I am to do your deeds justice, I must needs know all that took place that fateful day, down to the finest detail.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_000 -- You have short questions, I have short answers. Relatively speaking, of course.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_005 -- Allow me a moment to deviate from my normal routine and thank you personally for rescuing my dear friend Jenomis: thank you.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_006 -- With that out of the way, what is it you would like to know?

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_Q1_000_000 -- What will you ask?

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_A1_000_000 -- Who is Jenomis cen Lexentale?

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_A1_000_001 -- What is the Majestic Theater Company?

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_A1_000_002 -- What is the Zodiac Brave Story?

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_A1_000_003 -- How is the Majestic's telling different from legend?

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_A1_000_004 -- What happened to Dalmasca?

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_A1_000_005 -- Who are you and what is a dramaturge?

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_A1_000_006 -- Do you know the wandering minstrel?

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_A1_000_0010 -- Nothing.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_100 -- Jenomis had been at the Magitek Academy for but a handful of summers when he founded his own theater troupe, and it was but a handful more before his plays began attracting recognition in various influential literary circles.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_101 -- Although Jenomis is not a prolific writer, what he lacks in quantity he makes up tenfold in quality. The public especially adored the few pieces he both produced and starred in. So popular were his troupe's productions that admirers would have to book their seats a year or more in advance.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_102 -- And though he was widely regarded as one of the finest playwrights in the Empire, none was more surprised than Jenomis himself when Emperor Solus zos Galvus, in recognition of the young principal's accomplishments, presented him with his very own airship.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_103 -- This has since become a source of considerable ire for the new emperor, but I think Jenomis would have it no other way. You see, where his art is concerned, Jenomis will not compromise. He will write and rewrite and then rewrite again until he has achieved what he believes to be perfection.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_104 -- He will create something so perfect that even his greatest detractor will be forced to acknowledge its genius. Critics applaud Jenomis for his cunning, but I know it to be merely a by-product of his inherent stubbornness. Jenomis simply cannotâ”€will notâ”€settle for anything less than the best.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_120 -- Since its inception during Jenomis's Academy days, the Majestic Theater Company has been busily producing and performing some of the Empire's most memorable works.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_121 -- From tragedies to comedies, classics to modern adaptations, monodrama to musicals, there was nothing the Majestic couldn't doâ”€and do brilliantly.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_122 -- At the time of <Emphasis>The Zodiac Brave Story</Emphasis>'s debut, the theater was home to over five score performers and stagehands, all living here on the <Emphasis>Prima Vista</Emphasis>. Now... Well, you can see where we stand.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_140 -- The Zodiac Brave Story is a tale as old as time.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_141 -- Whenever the kingdom was threatened, be it by tyranny, evil forces, or realm-wide disaster, twelve blessed heroes would emerge to bring light back to Ivalice. Those twelve were known as the Zodiac Braves.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_142 -- Each era had its own Zodiac Bravesâ”€MÃ¼llenkamp the star seer, Saint Ajora, the assassin Ashley. I can list at least five others, but by far the most popular has always been King Delita.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_143 -- Following the death of its king, Ivalice's long-standing Atkascha dynasty finds itself without an heir. In an attempt to claim the throne, the Order of the Northern Sky under the banner of the White Lion and the Order of the Southern Sky under the Black Lion wage war, resulting in the death of thousands and a veritable stalemate.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_144 -- When all of Ivalice was at war with itself, he and eleven of his most trusted companions set out to bring order to the realm. Though not of noble birth, Delita would ultimately unite the land as regent, and the twelve became known as that era's Zodiac Braves.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_145 -- There has been much debate as to whether the legend is based on actual historical events or merely fiction, but most scholars agree that there is simply too little evidence to substantiate claims of Ivalice's existence.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_146 -- There are no ruins, there are no relics. And the stories we are left with...well, they are just thatâ”€stories. What's worse, there are so many of them, each with its own peculiarities, that only the most basic elements actually line up.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_147 -- Even some of the more recent renderings of the legend feature dramatic deviations, the most notable being that Delita was assassinated before even taking the throne, instead of becoming king after his marriage to Princess Ovelia Atkascha.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_148 -- But that has always been the trouble with bards and minstrels. You can't trust a single one of them not to change the story here or there for the sake of a rhyme.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_149 -- And so here we are, left in the dark without a light to ponder a mystery only the gods know.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_160 -- Unsurprisingly there are many plays which attempt a telling of the Zodiac Brave Story, but none have been as well received as the Majestic's rendition.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_161 -- When Jenomis told me he was considering his own retelling of the legend, I was not remotely surprised. When he subsequently revealed his intention to make it a musical, however, I nearly spat out my mead.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_162 -- Not content simply to write the play, he composed the music, penned the lyrics, and even saw to the damned <Emphasis>choreography</Emphasis>. I had never seen anything like it. With the completion of <Emphasis>The Zodiac Brave Story</Emphasis>, he proved his genius once and for all.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_163 -- The musical is divided into five acts, the first three focusing on Delita's service to the Church of Glabados, his first encounter with Princess Ovelia Atkascha, and his subsequent oath to see her become queen.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_164 -- The final two acts move to the War of the Lions, culminating in Delita's betrothal to the princess, and their tragic end.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_165 -- The ensemble scene in which Delita, lost in his web of lies, reveals the truth of his plans to the gods on one side of the stage, while on the other, Princess Ovelia swears to the selfsame gods that she will put the past behind her... <Emphasis>Genius.</Emphasis> A masterpiece of modern theater.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_180 -- The Dalmasca Desert is a vast wasteland situated in the southern reaches of central Othard, sharing an eastern border with Nagxia. So large is the desert that it is divided into two regions, the Estersands and the Westersands.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_181 -- Thirty years ago, the kingdom of Dalmasca was invaded by the Garlean Empire. When the king and his council refused to pledge fealty to the Empire, war erupted, resulting in the end of the royal B'nargin line.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_182 -- For a thousand years, Dalmasca had maintained its independence, only to see it crumble in a matter of moons before the might of Solus zos Galvus's metal-clad legions. Even the Royal City of Rabanastreâ”€the fabled Desert Sapphireâ”€was not spared.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_183 -- Emboldened by the uprisings in Doma and Ala Mhigo, resistance groups within Dalmasca have attempted coups of their own, yet all have been silencedâ”€the Empire always seeming to know exactly when and where the insurgencies would begin.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_184 -- When I was a boy, I accompanied my father on one of his caravans to Rabanastre, and consider myself fortunate to have seen the Royal City before its fall. The sight of its minarets bathed in the gold of sunset is something I will never forget.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_200 -- Who am I? A simple question with a not-so-simple answer. I can begin by telling you who I am not: namely, a member of the Majestic Theater Company.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_201 -- I am a playwright like Principal Lexentale, but unlike him, I have chosen to remain independent. Jenomis is an old friend, and when I heard he would be making the journey east, I asked if I could join him. You see, I too share many of the ideals that have fallen out of favor in the imperial court.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_202 -- As for who is the better writer...well, it is not for me to say. I will, however, admit to being a considerably <Emphasis>slower</Emphasis> writer, as my publishers will all too readily attest. To make matters worse, I have also developed a passion for cookery of late, and spend a great deal of my time here assisting the galley staff in exchange for my passage on the <Emphasis>Prima Vista</Emphasis>. Perhaps a change of profession is in order...

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_220 -- The minstrel? With the disheveled hair? As strange a fish as any I've seen...and I have seen plenty on my travels.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_221 -- Most bards simply retell the tales of high adventure, adding a twang of the lute here and a toot of the fife there for flavor. But the wandering minstrel is different. He seems more inclined to challenge his audience than entertain them.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_222 -- One might say he is a god creating worlds for his children to play in. Or not. A god would never be caught wearing those spectacles. Still, there is much a playwright like myself might learn from such a fellow...

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_Q2_000_000 -- What will you ask?

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_A2_000_000 -- About the Garlean occupation of Dalmasca.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_A2_000_001 -- About the Dalmascan uprising.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_A2_000_002 -- 

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_A2_000_0010 -- Nothing.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_300 -- It has been almost thirty summers since the Empire's conquest of Dalmascaâ”€the annexation coming some years before the invasions of both Ala Mhigo and Doma.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_301 -- The campaign was led by Legatus Noah van Gabranth of the IVth Imperial Legion, and waged over six bloody moons.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_302 -- It was the fall of the supposedly impenetrable stronghold at Nalbina, with the loss of some seventy thousand Dalmascan swords, that ultimately turned the tide in the Empire's favor.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_303 -- When it was discovered that the list of casualties included both Prince Rasler and his twin sister Princess Ashelia, all fight left the embattled regent and he soon thereafter conceded the crown.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_304 -- He passed not long after his surrender, and while the official explanation was that he succumbed to illness, rumors of suicide and even assassination persist to this day. What is certain, however, is that with his death, the B'nargin lineâ”€one that had endured for a thousand summersâ”€finally came to an end.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_320 -- The Dalmascans took to their new rulers about as well as one might expect, and in the years since the annexation, several sizable uprisings have caught flame, only to be quelled by the Empire's might.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_321 -- That does not, however, mean we Garleans have emerged from these bouts of insurrection unscathed. One recent example is the Barheim Incident, in which scores of imperial colonists met their end.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_322 -- In response to this rather arbitrary display of defiance, the Emperor sent the XIVth Legion back to Dalmasca, where, under the watch of Livia sas Junius, suspected rebels were hunted down like rats and slaughtered without trial.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_323 -- Of course, this served only to embolden the resistance. Yet, the ending of their tale was not as happy as those told in Doma and Ala Mhigo...as you will have gleaned from your recent visit to Rabanastre.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_324 -- Which is not to say the resistance is no more. If anything, it grows stronger, its members biding their time deep in the endless labyrinth that lies beneath the capital.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_325 -- I have even heard it whispered that they are now rallied under a new leaderâ”€a charismatic young firebrand the people call â€œPrincess Ashe.â€� What? Of course it cannot be the <Emphasis>real</Emphasis> Ashelia. Even had she survived the tragedy at Nalbina, Her Highness would by now have seen nigh on fifty summers!

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_340 -- 

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_341 -- 

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_500 -- The body is but a vessel for the soul... A puppet which bends to the soul's...something... And lo, the body is not eternal, forâ”€

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_501 -- Ah, you must forgive me, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. I was lost in my work. Several of my patrons are expecting returns on their considerable investments, you see.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_510 -- It must feed on the flesh of others...lest it return to the dust whence it came. Therefore must the soul deceive...despise, and murder...something...

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_511 -- What was that, you ask? Oh, a little something commissioned by a local noble. It <Emphasis>has</Emphasis> been several moons since I accepted his coin, so I figured 'twas high time I put pen to parchment.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_512 -- Was there aught <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> needed?

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_520 -- If what we just witnessed were truly teleportation magicks, then the amount of aether required to create a portal that large from such a distance would surely be immense.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_530 -- Yes, it would appear that Ultima has abandoned Alma, only to take possession of her poor brother.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_531 -- But riddle me this, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>â”€what type of being would require a mortal vessel? 

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_532 -- Correct, one without a corporeal form of its own. So the true question is, then, now that the High Seraph has one in Ramza, what exactly will she become?

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_533 -- Our only hope is that if Ultima requires Ramza's body to wield her might, then she will do everything in her power to keep it from harm.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_540 -- Words cannot describe how happy we all are to have Ramza back aboard the <Emphasis>Prima Vista</Emphasis>...and it is literally my job to use words to describe things.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_550 -- I run, you give chase... I am the hart...and you the...something... But this hart has laid... Has laidâ”€

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_551 -- Ah, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! You have caught me again in the throes of a bloody bout with my archnemesis, writer's block. Perhaps a change of pace would serve me well.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_552 -- Was there aught <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> needed?

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_Q3_000_000 -- What will you ask?

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_A3_000_000 -- About Viera culture.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_A3_000_001 -- About Viera physiology.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_A3_000_002 -- About Dalmascan refugees.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_A3_000_010 -- Nothing.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_600 -- Ah, yes. I have learned much of the leporine folk during my travels, so let us start off with the most basic of detailsâ”€there exist two distinct clans, the light-skinned Veena Viera, and the darker-skinned Rava Viera.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_601 -- The word Viera itself means â€œpeople of the wood,â€� and true to that name, both the Rava and the Veena make their homes exclusively in the Golmore Jungle, or the primeval forests which line the southwestern foothills of the Skatay Range, respectively.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_602 -- Until recentlyâ”€perhaps the past several generationsâ”€a Viera living outside her homeland was unheard of, and those who abandoned their tribes were branded outcasts.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_603 -- You see, the Viera follow a strict code called the â€œGreen Wordâ€� that binds them to their land and prohibits all contact with the outside world unless absolutely necessary.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_604 -- Similar to that of the Miqo'te Keepers of the Moon, the Viera's societal hierarchy is strictly matriarchal. You will find no males in the villages of both the Veena and the Rava, let alone in positions of rule.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_605 -- Yet, that does not mean they do not play an important role in Viera society. The males take up the mantle of Wood-warderâ”€protectors of the forestâ”€and serve their tribes by seeing no evil encroach on their tribe's sacred demesne.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_606 -- Males, for the most part, are reclusive, shunning contact with even their own kin, save for the rare occasion they return to their village of birth to sow their seed and to claim any boys who have reached adulthood...but I shall speak of that queer custom at length later.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_607 -- In other words, tread not the wood with hopes of finding a male Viera, for you will be met with naught but disappointment...or worse, death.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_608 -- This, however, is not to discredit the martial prowess of female Viera. The women of the wood are as formidable as the men, and merely choose to devote their attention to the protection of their hearth and young.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_609 -- Without a supportive community, the males must constantly struggle to survive. Food, clothing, weapons, medicinesâ”€all must be procured or crafted by the individual and without the aid of another. The male lives alone and dies alone. This has gone unchanged for countless generations.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_610 -- I spent many a moon in the Desert Sapphire, and while I saw all manner of wondrous creatures, not once did I lay mine eyes upon a male Viera, nor did I hear of one living in the city. They simply do not exist to us.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_620 -- For the Viera, the hands of time move at a far more leisurely pace than they do for the rest of us. Whereas a Hyur might consider themselves fortunate to see, say, eighty winters before <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> return to the Lifestream, a Viera can endure up to twelve score or more.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_621 -- It is estimated that upwards of eight in ten Viera are born female, though it is not until at least the thirteenth namedayâ”€when the individual moves from adolescence into adulthoodâ”€that the individual's gender becomes apparent.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_622 -- Then, for the next two centuries will the Viera maintain its physical youth, rendering it nigh impossible to discern one's age simply from outward appearances.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_623 -- When it is revealed that a Viera kit is a male, it will be given into the care of another, that it may learn the ways of the Wood-warderâ”€protectors of the forest.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_624 -- Once every three to five summers, male Viera will descend from the trees to a nearby village to mate.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_625 -- It is at this time, if there are any recently discovered jacks still living amongst the females, that the older male will make them his wards and teach them how to survive without the crutch of companionship.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_626 -- Only following countless seasons of training and strict adherence to the Green Word will the students themselves earn the title of master, and be allowed to seek solitude.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_627 -- More than few will perish during this brutal rite of passage, further thinning the tribe's males, until only those with the strongest seed remain.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_628 -- As I explained before, the duty of a male Vieraâ”€a Wood-warderâ”€is to see that their tribe's demesne remain untouched by the destructive whims of outsiders. Yet, they do so from the shadows, oft choosing to shoot first, and not even bother with questions.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_629 -- The females, on the other hand, are much more open in their relationship with the wood, though I use the term â€œopenâ€� in its most loosest of senses. More than simply defend the forest, they seek also to nurture itâ”€clearing undergrowth, removing fallen trees, planting seeds, eradicating vermin.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_630 -- Efforts by past kings to bring Viera lands under Dalmascan rule have been met with either indifference or violence. As of late, Rabanastre has suffered the Viera their self-governance, with the promise the villages will not take up their bows against the throne.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_631 -- When I was younger and far more the fool than I am now, I asked a Viera if she did not find her tribe's ways awkward. Was it not within the natural order for males and females of a species to coexist?

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_632 -- The woman answered me thus: â€œThe value of coexistence will not be found 'neath a loincloth.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_633 -- "Long has our kind endured understanding that the distance 'twixt two bodies does not dictate the distance 'twixt two souls.â€œ

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_640 -- I spoke with Lady Fran about her efforts to see Dalmasca's displaced relocated to both Doma and Eorzea.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_643 -- I spoke with Lady Fran about her efforts to see Dalmasca's displaced relocated to both Doma and Eorzea.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_645 -- A shrewd bit of compromise, if there ever was one. Not only will it save lives, but give the resistance one less thing to worry over, allowing them more time to concentrate on uniting their ranks.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_646 -- And there was no easy way for the Alliances to refuse the entreaty without painting themselves just as heartless as the Empire. This is the children and the elderly we are talking about here.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_647 -- Nevertheless, a logistical nightmare awaits those tasked with seeing the masses safely across the eastern and western borders. It will be quite an undertaking, and many might still perish.

TEXT_REGHIN3WANDERINGWRITER_00435_WANDERINGWRITER_000_648 -- However, it is my deepest desire that Dalmasca might eventually follow in the footsteps of her neighbors and finally break free from the imperial yoke. Ah, did I say â€œdeepest desireâ€�? Considering recent events, that was in poor taste. My apologies.

TEXT_REGHINCOMPANYMENMBERS43_00483_WANDERINGWRITER_000_000 -- Ah, a moogle. How quaint.

TEXT_REGHINCOMPANYMENMBERS43_00483_WANDERINGWRITER_000_010 -- Desert moogles, now? I suppose that would explain their current state of dishevelment.

TEXT_REGHINCOMPANYMENMBERS43_00483_WANDERINGWRITER_000_020 -- My fellow thespians are wont to claim that the Ridorana Cataract is a one-way gate to the seventh hell. While I am not about to take their word for it, neither am I inclined to put their theory to the proof.

TEXT_REGHINCOMPANYMENMBERS43_00483_WANDERINGWRITER_000_050 -- 

TEXT_REGHINCOMPANYMENMBERS43_00483_WANDERINGWRITER_000_070 -- 

TEXT_REGHINCOMPANYMENMBERS43_00483_WANDERINGWRITER_000_080 -- These auracite relics are fascinating, are they not? If only we knew how to harness their power...without being possessed, I mean.

TEXT_REGHINCOMPANYMENMBERS43_00483_WANDERINGWRITER_000_090 -- Another bout with a soulless denizen of the deep? No rest for the righteous, eh?

TEXT_REGHINCOMPANYMENMBERS43_00483_WANDERINGWRITER_000_091 -- If things take a turn for the worse, do not hesitate to flee. There is no shame in yielding the battle if it eventually wins you the war.

TEXT_REGHINCOMPANYMENMBERS43_00483_WANDERINGWRITER_000_040 -- They say a rose is a rose is a rose. So tell me, adventurer, is that a rose in your pocket, or are you simply here for small talk?

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_WANDERINGWRITER_000_000 -- â€œThere's few so loath to take their rest
Than 'venturers without a quest,
For shorn of work to give them worth,
They soon become a source of mirth.â€�

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_WANDERINGWRITER_000_020 -- I see I've struck a chord with you, my friend. My colleagues tell me that if one in this land ever needs an item <Emphasis>fetched</Emphasis> that you are the <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> to speak to. I find this philanthropic compulsion fascinating, and soâ”€in the interests of research into my next play, let's sayâ”€I seek to put said compulsion to the test...
Assuming you are game, of course.

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_WANDERINGWRITER_000_021 -- Bring me a bottle of wine. Ah, but not just any wine. Make it rose-themed. And make it Eorzean. I've had my fill of the bitter blends offered here in the East.

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_WANDERINGWRITER_000_022 -- Where to start? Oh, if only there were some <Emphasis>port</Emphasis> where thirsty Eorzeans went for their <Emphasis>wine</Emphasis>, you would surely be there speaking with its foremost <Emphasis>blind Lalafellin</Emphasis> vintner, and not here with me.

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_WANDERINGWRITER_000_030 -- Are you truly going to make me spell it out for you? Bah, all right. Go to Wineport in eastern La Noscea and speak with Shamani Lohmani. I am assured he is the region's leading authority. If he cannot point you in the direction of a proper drop, no one can.

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_WANDERINGWRITER_000_700 -- They say a rose is a rose is a rose. So tell me, adventurer, is that a rose in your pocket, or are you simply here for small talk?

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_WANDERINGWRITER_000_750 -- A bottle of vintage Suhd Viandja!? You never cease to amaze!

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_WANDERINGWRITER_000_751 -- But what is most amazing is your impeccable sense of timing. Today marks the twelfth anniversary of the day I met my dear wife... And if there was one thing she loved more than wine, it was roses. <sniff> Would that she were here today to...to...

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_WANDERINGWRITER_000_752 -- Ah, but I jest. My wife is very much alive. In fact...

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_WANDERINGWRITER_000_753 -- She's been here with us all along! Darling, would you care to join us?

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_WANDERINGWRITER_000_755 -- Forget the most important gift of all? Of course not!

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_WANDERINGWRITER_000_756 -- Bacon bread! The perfect companion to a perfect wine...for <Emphasis>my</Emphasis> perfect companion.

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_WANDERINGWRITER_000_800 -- That played out better than I imagined. I suppose I have you to thank, adventurer. Though, it <Emphasis>was</Emphasis> the bacon bread that sealed the deal...

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_WANDERINGWRITER_000_010 -- 

TEXT_STMBDI202_03090_WANDERINGWRITER_000_801 -- 

TEXT_STMBDI211_03093_WANDERINGWRITER_000_000 -- A beacon built atop the ruins of a lost city, you say? I would so like to hear more of this latest adventure...

TEXT_STMBDI211_03093_WANDERINGWRITER_000_001 -- But to do so <Emphasis>sans refreshment</Emphasis> would be in poor taste, indeed. I shall send for an assortment of viands and a bottle of my finest.

TEXT_STMBDI211_03093_WANDERINGWRITER_000_002 -- Then again, why send a minion to do the job of a master? Before me stands a <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> in a class all <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>his</If> own when it comes to matters of procurement...as you amply proved earlier.

TEXT_STMBDI211_03093_WANDERINGWRITER_000_003 -- After decades of experimentation, I have found that naught save the <Emphasis>freshest</Emphasis> of freshly baked bacon bread can truly be said to complement my vintage collection. So, shall we say...ten loaves? And none of that day-old stuff. Only the highest quality will do. Understood?

TEXT_STMBDI211_03093_WANDERINGWRITER_000_050 -- I imagine one with your myriad talents could procure ten loaves of high-quality bacon bread without a second thought. Mayhap I should have asked for a score...?

TEXT_STMBDI211_03093_WANDERINGWRITER_000_070 -- Tell me, what is that breathtaking aroma? The bouquet of roasted grain and sweet cream butter, accented by the subtle tang of woodsmoke... Could it be...?

TEXT_STMBDI211_03093_WANDERINGWRITER_000_071 -- Ahhh, it is! Bacon breadâ”€and of a quality seldom seen outside the realm's most decorated bakeries. So armed, we can at last celebrate the latest of your unparalleled achievements. A toast!

TEXT_STMBDI211_03093_WANDERINGWRITER_000_072 -- And yes, your reward. You must forgive me, for all I have to offer are these cracked crystals found on one of my wanderings through the ancient thoroughfares of Mhach. If you do not care for them, feel free to throw them away. I shall not be in the least offended.

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_WANDERINGWRITER_000_041 -- The Suhd Viandja was truly an amazing wine! I admit, before leaving Garlemald, I was worried the outlands' vintages would not agree with my palate, but oh, how I was wrong!

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_WANDERINGWRITER_000_042 -- Not only was the rosÃ© one of the best I've had during my time here, it is one of the best I've had...well, ever! I simply had to have more so...

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_WANDERINGWRITER_000_043 -- ...I went and purchased an entire crate of the stuff! Ah hah hah hah!

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_WANDERINGWRITER_000_045 -- I shall reserve my judgment on the verity of Hancock's â€œdeal,â€� but even were the price double, it would have been more than worth it.

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_WANDERINGWRITER_000_046 -- Fortunately, I recently sold an entire collection of my works to a little playhouse on Kogane Doriâ”€the Mujikoza, I believe they called themselves (these Hingan words leave my tongue in knots)â”€and scored myself a tidy profit.

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_WANDERINGWRITER_000_052 -- Do I...uh...want to know about this, Hancock?

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_WANDERINGWRITER_000_054 -- It sounds like you and Hancock make quite the cunning devils, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Still, I do feel somewhat responsible for this whole mess...

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_WANDERINGWRITER_000_055 -- As an apology, might I offer you a bottle of...vintage Suhd Viandja?

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_WANDERINGWRITER_000_056 -- No, of course not. Ahem. Then, what would you say to a bottle of Dalmascan? You could exchange it with the bottle you gave this Master Gegeruju and absolve yourself of all wrongdoing and whatnot.

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_WANDERINGWRITER_000_057 -- Ah, now you are probably wondering where one might find a bottle of genuine Dalmascan red, considering the hells you had to negotiate simply to find an <Emphasis>empty</Emphasis> bottle. Well that, my distrustful friend, is where Hancock comes in.

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_WANDERINGWRITER_000_075 -- Enough, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Poor Hancock looks as if he has lost his mistress to a morbol. Three bottles is more than fair to see your wounded honor restored.

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_WANDERINGWRITER_000_090 -- Think of it this way, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. If you hadn't saved the world from Ultima's bane, the High Seraph would most definitely have destroyed all that wine in the monastery simply out of spite. Meaning, you're entitled to at least those three.

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_WANDERINGWRITER_000_091 -- And, if you so desire, you can take one of those bottles back to Costa del Sol and set things right.

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_WANDERINGWRITER_000_092 -- Though, something tells me Master Gegeruju won't take kindly to you waltzing into his manor and demanding he exchange bottles for no apparent reason... Hm... Perhaps you might enlist the aid of that vintner from Wineport. What was his name again? Shamwow...Shamon...Shamani! Shamani Lohmani!

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_WANDERINGWRITER_000_100 -- Think of it this way, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. If you hadn't saved the world from Ultima's bane, the High Seraph would most definitely have destroyed all that wine in the monastery, simply out of spite.

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_WANDERINGWRITER_000_690 -- You're back! And, my, far quicker than last time. Everything off with nary a hitch then, I presume.

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_WANDERINGWRITER_000_691 -- That is truly, <Emphasis>truly</Emphasis> wonderful to hear...and I'm not simply saying that because there's been this nagging in my gut that's followed me since I asked you to fetch me some wine that fateful day.

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_WANDERINGWRITER_000_692 -- Please accept this as a token of my gratitude. I've been told you adventuring types fetâ”€er, collect them, as well.

TEXT_STMBDI311_03190_WANDERINGWRITER_000_040 -- 

TEXT_STMBDI312_03191_WANDERINGWRITER_000_050 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Did I ever tell you how much I adore this city? It's simply so...so...<Emphasis>exotic</Emphasis>! And the cuisine! Oh, the <Emphasis>cuisine</Emphasis>! I've never experienced so many flavors in my mouth at once!

TEXT_STMBDI312_03191_WANDERINGWRITER_000_051 -- Why, just the other day, I was given a jug of the most wonderful rice wine by the lad from the Mujikoza who purchased my collection of past works. Can you believe it? Wine, made of rice, of all things! What will they think of next?

TEXT_STMBDI312_03191_WANDERINGWRITER_000_052 -- Ah, but I suppose you're wondering why I had my darling summon you over. Well, it's this wine. While absolutely delightful, none of the nibbles I usually take with my traditional reds and whites pair well with the stuff. And so, once again, I require your help.

TEXT_STMBDI312_03191_WANDERINGWRITER_000_053 -- The kind woman who operates the shuttle to the <Emphasis>Prima Vista</Emphasis> tells me if I am to eat like a true Hingan, then I should start with grilled turban, tempura, and some ridiculous thing called â€œtako-yaki.â€� I believe three of each should suffice. And as always, only the best of the best.

TEXT_STMBDI312_03191_WANDERINGWRITER_000_100 -- Three servings of grilled turban, tempura, and tako-yaki...and nothing like that you'd find at a corner stall. I expect only the finest.

TEXT_STMBDI312_03191_WANDERINGWRITER_000_120 -- I never doubted you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! My darling, she may have doubted you, but me? Never! You have quite a knack for this line of work.

TEXT_STMBDI312_03191_WANDERINGWRITER_000_121 -- Now, let the festivities begin! Here is your reward. Please see yourself out.
