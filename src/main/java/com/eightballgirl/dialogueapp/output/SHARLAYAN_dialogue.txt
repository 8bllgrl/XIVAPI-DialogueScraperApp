TEXT_REGNOT5OLDSHARLAYAN_00738_WAMEME_000_101 -- I like to come here for a bit of fresh air between classes, but for some reason, I'm asked for directions rather often. So I decided: why not act as a guide?

TEXT_REGNOT5OLDSHARLAYAN_00738_WAMEME_000_200 -- Sharlayan is the city of knowledge. Once a humble settlement founded by Archon Nyunkrepf and the refugees he rescued from the great flood of the Sixth Umbral Calamity, it has since flourished into the grand metropolis you see today.

TEXT_REGNOT5OLDSHARLAYAN_00738_WAMEME_000_204 -- But what use are names if the Final Days leaves all in ruin? I know I am not alone when I pray that your endeavor beyond the stars culminates in our salvationâ”€and your safe return, of course!

TEXT_REGNOT5SHARLAYANHAMLET_00744_SYRENEAD_000_022 -- It has been goodness knows how many years since last I left, myself. Considering the importance of my work, however, I am perfectly content right where I am. Just between the two of us, though, I do miss the ocean. Just a little.

TEXT_REGNOT5SHARLAYANHAMLET_00744_SYRENEAD_000_023 -- Many of us are engaged in highly classified research. In fact, there was a time when none could leave Labyrinthos for fear our secrets might fall into the wrong hands. That isn't the case anymore, of course. We are no longer under lock and key, as it were.

TEXT_REGNOT5SHARLAYANHAMLET_00744_SYRENEAD_000_024 -- It was you and your efforts, in fact, which brought about this change. The strictures which kept us so long locked inside have relaxed a great deal, and I mean to take full advantage. The next opportunity I get, I'm going to the beach!

Character is mentioned:
TEXT_AKTKBB101_04067_SEQ_00 -- The Sharlayan maiden is taking in the scenery with fascination.

â€»This quest will unlock the sage job.

TEXT_AKTKBB101_04067_SEQ_01 -- As you make your way through the lower decks of Limsa Lominsa, an outlandishly dressed maiden catches your eye. Curiosity piqued, you approach her and learn that she is Lalah Jinjahl, a Sharlayan operative come to Eorzea on a Forum-sanctioned mission to capture fugitives. Lalah seeks an adventurer to serve as her escort, and you agree to lend her your aid. Before divulging the particulars of the mission, she suggests moving to more private surrounds, and you head outside the Zephyr Gate to continue your conversation.

TEXT_AKTKBB101_04067_LALAHJINJAHL_000_005 -- (-Lalah Jinjahl-)I am Lalah Jinjahl, a native of Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKBB101_04067_LALAHJINJAHL_000_022 -- As I mentioned, I am on the trail of fugitivesâ”€criminals who fled Sharlayan and came to these shores.

TEXT_AKTKBB101_04067_LALAHJINJAHL_100_032 -- The technological secrets which were stolen were contained in a similar crystal. This particular sample has been loaned to me by a healing institute in Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_SEQ_04 -- The man introduces himself as Faldrinet, and to Lalah's surprise, he is not only a fellow Sharlayan, but a sage besidesâ”€a traveling healer who offers his services gratis to those in need. Though he does not know why he was attacked, he theorizes that his assailants, whom Lalah is confident are the fugitives, wish to obtain forbidden plants that still grow at Saint Mocianne's Arboretum.

TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_SEQ_09 -- Outside the arboretum, Lalah reveals that the pouch held an unknown plant. Furthermore, she chanced upon a diary which appears to belong to a Sharlayan sage. Though the fugitives and their objective still elude you, you have these clues to show for your efforts, and head back to Idyllshire to take stock.

TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_GUILDIVAIN_100_032 -- (-Faldrinet-)Permit me to introduce myself. Faldrinet of Sharlayan, at your service.

TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_LALAHJINJAHL_100_034 -- I am Sharlayan tooâ”€a recent graduate of the Studium, in fact. Would you mind telling us what happened?

TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_GUILDIVAIN_100_042 -- (-Faldrinet-)Following the exodus, the cultivation of certain plants became forbidden in Sharlayan. But that which can no longer be found in the motherland still grows freely there, among which are potent-but-dangerous herbs...

TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_GUILDIVAIN_100_044 -- (-Faldrinet-)Hmmm... You too are a sage, yet you do not appear to be Sharlayan. How did you come by your soul crystal?

TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_GUILDIVAIN_100_050 -- (-Faldrinet-)This did not sit well with me, and so I left Sharlayan behindâ”€as the great Master Louisoix once did. And though I would never dare equate myself to him, I too believe it my duty to alleviate suffering in the world.

TEXT_AKTKBB102_04068_LALAHJINJAHL_000_060 -- I've dispatched the plant to Sharlayan for identification. When we learn what it is, I believe we will gain insight into the villains' objective.

TEXT_AKTKBB111_04069_SEQ_00 -- Lalah Jinjahl is eager to share tidings from the Sharlayan motherland.

TEXT_AKTKBB111_04069_SEQ_06 -- You find Mahaud and Ancel still suffering from their mysterious ailment. Observing their symptoms prompts Lalah to recall rumors of a forbidden procedure said to have been conducted by a Sharlayan healer years agoâ”€rumors that were summarily dismissed by the Forum. Nevertheless, the fugitives' plight gives her cause to wonder...but Loifa offers no confirmation and simply mocks her naivety. Again they make to teleport away, but ere they do so, the apothecary hesitantly steps forward, having recognized Mahaud and Ancel as her children...

TEXT_AKTKBB111_04069_SEQ_07 -- The confrontation thus concluded, the apothecary recounts her tale. Mahaud and Ancel are her adopted children, she explains, and when they were both gravely ill, a Sharlayan healer by the name of Guildivain appeared and offered to cure them. The man took them away, and she had not seen them for years...until they seemingly came for Faldrinet.

TEXT_AKTKBB111_04069_LALAHJINJAHL_000_000 -- Wonderful timing, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Remember that mystery plant I sent to Sharlayan for analysis? I received the results not long ago.

TEXT_AKTKBB111_04069_LALAHJINJAHL_000_002 -- 'Tis most certainly why the fugitives came to Eorzea. Unable to obtain the herb in Sharlayan, they decided to procure it from the arboretum.

TEXT_AKTKBB111_04069_PHARMACY04069_000_124 -- Guildivain, he called himself. A healer of some renown in his native Sharlayan, I believe.

TEXT_AKTKBB111_04069_PHARMACY04069_000_134 -- To have so many kindly healers, Sharlayan must be a wonderful place indeed.

TEXT_AKTKBB121_04070_SEQ_01 -- Though Lalah had assumed that Loifa and his companions were criminals, she is increasingly of the belief that they may instead be victims seeking revenge. Her suspicions are also supported by the fact that, in response to her reports, authorities in Sharlayan reopened their investigation into the rumors of a mad healer who conducted heinous procedures...and confirmed that there was truth to them after all. Moreover, a sage named Guildivainâ”€the man who took Mahaud and Ancel into his careâ”€disappeared from Sharlayan shortly before the fugitives first appeared. On the assumption that Guildivain and the villainous healer are one and the same, and that he has since assumed the guise of Faldrinet, Lalah decides to confront the man. Thus do you set forth for Aleport to seek out the merchant he frequents.

TEXT_AKTKBB121_04070_LALAHJINJAHL_000_007 -- There is something else, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. The rumors I mentioned, of a Sharlayan healer who conducted heinous procedures on live subjects... After sharing recent developments with command, they reopened the investigation...and have, to our considerable shock and surprise, confirmed that there appears to be some truth to them after all.

TEXT_AKTKBB121_04070_LALAHJINJAHL_100_007 -- The villain went to great lengths to conceal his operation, and thus did he manage to elude the authorities for years. The man's identity is yet to be conclusively ascertained, but we have a suspect: a sage who disappeared from Sharlayan shortly before our fugitives first appeared. A sage by the name of Guildivain.

TEXT_AKTKBB121_04070_LALAHJINJAHL_000_035 -- What we <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> know, however, is that they took a life in Sharlayan. They are murderers.

TEXT_AKTKBB121_04070_LOIFA_000_066 -- With the wisdom of Sharlayan he could cure me, he said. Having believed for so long that I never had a chance, I wasn't sure how to feel, but my master was...overjoyed. And seeing that joy... For the first time I wanted to live. For him. For me.

TEXT_AKTKBB121_04070_LOIFA_000_098 -- ...Guildivain had already fled Sharlayan. We were attempting to escape when one of our comrades collapsed in pain.

TEXT_AKTKBB141_04072_SEQ_04 -- Though Ancel wants nothing more than to put Guildivain out of his misery, Mahaud believes that Loifa should be the one to decide the villain's fate. And true to his pledge, he spares the man in favor of having him face justice in Sharlayan. Loifa then offers to return his soul crystal to Lalah, but she bids him keep it and, through his deeds, bring honor to her mother's memory.

TEXT_AKTKBB141_04072_SEQ_05 -- Upon returning to Idyllshire, Lalah informs Loifa and his friends that she has reported their disappearance to her superiors. As the sordid details of Guildivain's experiments have been brought to lightâ”€possibly in spite of the Forum's best effortsâ”€the former fugitives' innocence has been made plain. Thus do they need no longer fear pursuit by the Sharlayan authorities and are free to begin anew. Loifa promises to use his powers for good while seeking a cure for Mahaud and Ancel, and they will likewise continue to stand by him. Inspired by their resolve, you make a silent pledge to continue doing your part, bearing the hopes of sages past and fighting for the future of all lives.

TEXT_AKTKBB141_04072_GUILDIVAIN_000_028 -- You play the part of the indignant moralist well. Pity. As a fellow Sharlayan, I held out hope that you, at least, would come to appreciate my vision. Alas, you are as shortsighted as the rest.

TEXT_AKTKBB141_04072_LALAHJINJAHL_000_034 -- As for youâ”€I would thank you never to call me a fellow Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKBB141_04072_LALAHJINJAHL_000_070 -- With your blessing, I hereby take Guildivain into custody. He will be transported back to Sharlayan, where he will be tried by the Forum.

TEXT_AKTKBB141_04072_LALAHJINJAHL_000_080 -- When I set out from Sharlayan, I wanted to reclaim my mother's soul crystal. Wanted it as a memento to remember her by.

TEXT_AKTKBB141_04072_LOIFA_000_090 -- You took your time. Let me guess: you were talking with your superiors, and making arrangements to send us back to Sharlayan as well.

TEXT_AKTKBB141_04072_LALAHJINJAHL_000_092 -- Though they were pleased that Guildivain would be returning to Sharlayanâ”€alive, no lessâ”€they were deeply disappointed to hear that the fugitives escaped. And that, despite my best efforts, I could not pick up their trail again.

TEXT_AKTKBB141_04072_LOIFA_000_095 -- Well, now. You're surprisingly reasonable for a mull-headed Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKBZ001_04579_SEQ_01 -- Though efforts to thwart blasphemies born of the Final Days proceed apace, trouble yet lurks in the snows of Garlemald. Much to Shirabaht's surprise, Sharlayan has requested aid for the Garleans, and though the Ilsabard contingent has already deployed forces to aid them, Shirabaht asks if you might also lend a hand. No sooner do you nod your head in consent than she bids you make for Camp Broken Glass to speak with their intelligence officer.

TEXT_AKTKBZ001_04579_SHIRABAHT_100_009 -- Truly? Our contacts in Sharlayan will be thrilled to hear it. Though they did not explicitly request your presence, it was clear from the first they were hoping for it.

TEXT_AKTKBZ001_04579_SHIRABAHT_100_010 -- I should certainly think so. No sooner did we receive the request from Sharlayan than they began making preparations to dispatch their forces. That said, it was clear from the first they were hoping you might also take up the hunt.

TEXT_AKTKBZ001_04579_SHIRABAHT_000_010 -- Though if I may be frank, I was not expecting Sharlayan of all places to be so concerned with the present state of Garlemald, what with their strict policies on nonintervention. Perhaps we'll find out the reason before this is all over.

TEXT_AKTKBZ001_04579_FOURCHENAULT_000_029 -- Sharlayan has long had the honor of boasting incomparable repositories of the world's knowledge, but it is far from perfect.

TEXT_AKTKBZ001_04579_FOURCHENAULT_000_042 -- I should like to join you, if I may. As this endeavor was originally undertaken on Sharlayan's behalf, I feel it is my responsibility to see this through to its conclusion.

TEXT_AKTKBZ002_04580_SEQ_07 -- Witnesses to the transformation noted that the man affected was listening to a radio which continues to play a strange, cryptic message. As you consider who could be sending this broadcast, you are soon joined by Aymeric, Merlwyb, Artoirel, and the Gridanian sentry. You listen to the radio together once more, and part of its message strikes a chord with the sentryâ”€he recalls it being the mantra of Nerva yae Galvus of the IIIrd Legion. With this newfound information, Fourchenault is now convinced that Nerva is the blasphemy they are searching for.

Before long, the group's attention turns to the more immediate concern of the Garlean refugees. Though reluctant at first, they are soon convinced to discuss forming an interim governing body, as well as the possibility of rebuilding Garlemald or immigrating to Sharlayan. The Grand Company leaders have much to think about, affording you the opportunity to rest until there is new word of the blasphemy.

TEXT_AKTKBZ002_04580_FOURCHENAULT_000_212 -- If you should still see no merit in the rebuilding of Garlemald, then I would instead offer you residency in Sharlayan. I promise you will be welcomed with open arms.

TEXT_AKTKBZ002_04580_PRICKLYRETURNEE_000_213 -- Sharlayan? So now you'd expect us to go and lick boots in some country we've never even heard of?

TEXT_AKTKBZ002_04580_FOURCHENAULT_000_216 -- To be clear, you would not be migrating to Sharlayan to live in servitude. You have my word that each and every one of you would be guaranteed citizenship upon entry.

TEXT_AKTKBZ002_04580_FOURCHENAULT_000_218 -- Sharlayan was long aware of the coming doom that would be the Final Days, and so we were preparing to evacuate this star, taking as many people and resources as our stores would allow.

TEXT_AKTKBZ003_04581_NERO_000_090 -- A wise man would not waste his time on a few wayward refugees. I thought you Sharlayan scholars knew better.

TEXT_AKTKBZ003_04581_FOURCHENAULT_000_145 -- I'll not deny your situation is dire, but you are not without a path forward. I believe you've the passion and conviction needed to rebuild Garlemald, if you so chose. Or, failing that, you could begin life anew in Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKBZ004_04582_FOURCHENAULT_000_124 -- The duty of Sharlayan has ever been to chart the course of history, not to change it. Thus did we fervently hold to our policies of neutrality and nonintervention.

TEXT_AKTKBZ004_04582_FOURCHENAULT_000_128 -- Sharlayan will now find a new way forward. Not merely for the preservation of knowledge, but for the betterment of this star, and all who call it home.

TEXT_AKTKEA102_04537_SEQ_01 -- In order to solve the phantom realm's mysteries, G'raha believes that a thorough investigation is in order. But ere you are able to set off for Sharlayan to make the necessary arrangements, four mysterious beings appear who claim to be of the Twelve, the guardian deities of Eorzean myth. They declare that, in Hydaelyn's absence, they are the rightful rulers of the star, and you must prove your strength if mankind is to remain the master of his own destiny. After the gods take their leave, G'raha Tia expresses his uncertainty over the unexpected developments, but concedes that they may have far-reaching implications. So it is that you resolve to answer the gods' challenge, and formally accept the request to investigate the phantom realm.

TEXT_AKTKEA102_04537_GRAHATIA_000_015 -- Without further ado, then, let us return to Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKEA103_04538_GRAHATIA_000_053 -- This practice has continued to the present day in Eorzea, with some notable regional differences. For instance, Ishgardians hold Halone as absolute, while Sharlayans enjoy a moderate relationship with Thaliak.

TEXT_AKTKEA104_04539_GRAHATIA_000_089 -- May I introduce Snoegeim, expert mythologist. She is a collaborator of the Students, and like many a Sharlayan scholar, is passionate about her endeavors to the point of forgetting to eat.

TEXT_AKTKLA301_04146_SEQ_03 -- Reinvigorated by Debroye's sumptuous lobster dish, you listen intently as she describes how the professor's revolting panaloaf came to be. Debroye is greatly concerned by the idea that the awful bread may be adopted not only as an emergency recipe, but also as a staple of the Sharlayan diet. She pleads with you to return with her to Makers' Meet, and aid her efforts in improving the taste of this â€œperfect meal.â€�

TEXT_AKTKLA301_04146_SEQ_04 -- You arrive at Makers' Meet, and indicate your willingness to assist Debroye in her gastronomic endeavor. The fate of Sharlayan's dietary culture hangs in the balance...

TEXT_AKTKLA301_04146_DEBROYE_000_044 -- By and large, Sharlayans prefer meals that are easily prepared and easily consumed over more flavorful, but less time-efficient, culinary efforts. Scholars busy with their research will settle for sandwiches more often than not.

TEXT_AKTKLA301_04146_DEBROYE_000_046 -- As a Sharlayan myself, I never had much interest in fine dining. Then I tried a dish at the Last Stand, and it was as if an entirely new world had opened up before me...

TEXT_AKTKLA301_04146_A3_000_001 -- Sharlayan's larders must be saved!

TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DEBROYE_000_032 -- I would, however, like to hear the opinion of theâ”€to my knowledgeâ”€foremost gourmand in Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DICKON_000_042 -- Ah, you remind me of old Mervyn. He was the fellow who built this place, and dedicated his life to bringing fine food to Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKLA303_04148_DICKON_000_045 -- Listen, the Last Stand was named so for a reason. We're a cultural outpostâ”€the final defense against those who would condemn Sharlayan's diet to blandness and monotony!

TEXT_AKTKLA304_04149_DEBROYE_100_057 -- But we cannot give up! For the sake of Sharlayan's bellies, you must help me win the Forum's minds!

TEXT_AKTKLA305_04150_DEBROYE_000_031 -- ...Yes, this is my first visit to Thavnair. To be perfectly honest, this is the first time I've ever left Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKLA305_04150_DEBROYE_100_063 -- They've spared no expense on this facility... When it comes to the field of alchemy, it would seem that Radzâ€“atâ€“Han is malms ahead of everyone elseâ”€even the learned professors of Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKLA305_04150_DEBROYE_000_122 -- My name is Debroye, and I study nutrition at the Studium in Sharlayan. I come seeking wisdom from the foremost expert in the fieldâ”€that being you, of course!

TEXT_AKTKLA305_04150_DEBROYE_000_176 -- And although I would love to more thoroughly explore Radzâ€“atâ€“Han's gourmet delights, we must hurry back to Sharlayan. Perhaps another time!

TEXT_AKTKLA307_04152_SEQ_02 -- Following a lengthy debate, and swayed by the arguments of Master Flaugustertâ”€a former Forum member and current patron of the Last Standâ”€the assembled officials adopt Mervynbread to serve as Sharlayan's emergency food supply. Debroye turns to you after hearing the decision, ready to share her elation.

TEXT_AKTKLA307_04152_SEQ_06 -- Debroye thanks you profusely for your assistance in her quest to create the perfect meal. With Professor Galveroche now joining her on the road of taste-related research, she vows to continue her mission to find acceptance for fine dining in the heartsâ”€and belliesâ”€of Sharlayan's citizens.

TEXT_AKTKLA307_04152_TODO_03 -- <If(LessThan(IntegerParameter(1),IntegerParameter(2)))>Synthesize a Sharlayan fishcake ingredient <Sheet(Addon,9,0)/><Else/>Deliver the Sharlayan fishcake ingredient <Sheet(Addon,9,0)/> to Debroye</If>.

TEXT_AKTKLA307_04152_FLAUGUSTERT_000_071 -- It is an unfortunate fact that fine food is oft regarded with contempt here in Sharlayan. Many see the pursuit of gourmet cuisine as a trivial distractionâ”€an inefficient use of one's precious time.

TEXT_AKTKLA307_04152_FACILITATOR04152_000_081 -- Panaloaf, one vote. Mervynbread, five votes. Congratulations, Miss Debroyeâ”€your submission has been accepted as Sharlayan's official emergency meal replacement recipe.

TEXT_AKTKLA307_04152_DICKON_000_095 -- I hear your submission humbled the professor at the evaluation! Nice work, and thank you for defending the innocent taste buds of Sharlayan!

TEXT_AKTKLA307_04152_DEBROYE_000_116 -- They may be simple dishes, but Sharlayan does have its own local specialties. The art of quality cuisine was never wholly absent from our culture...despite what people think.

TEXT_AKTKLA401_04153_SEQ_03 -- Professor Tankin explains that his research is focused on recreating the lifestyles of other cultures so that he can ascertain which is best suited to enrich the lives of the people in Sharlayan. You agree to aid him by gathering whatever materials he needs to carry out his work. Not wishing to waste time, Professor Tankin excuses himself to consider where to begin with his research, leaving you to speak with Hinageshi.

TEXT_AKTKLA401_04153_HINAGESHI_000_030 -- How I can be so certain of his whereabouts? He is a Sharlayan scholar through and through. Where else would a man seeking knowledge while away his time?

TEXT_AKTKLA401_04153_TANKIN_000_071 -- The study of a thousand thousand civilizations, and nothing here has changed. The culture of Sharlayan remains as stagnant as the threadbare attire we wear day in and day out.

TEXT_AKTKLA401_04153_HINAGESHI_000_073 -- But to be perfectly honest, I have no real qualms with the way we live here in Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKLA401_04153_HINAGESHI_000_105 -- â€œWe Au Ra have our roots in the Far East, though I only know the Sharlayan way of life,â€� he said.

TEXT_AKTKLA401_04153_TANKIN_000_120 -- As you are doubtless aware, Sharlayan is frightfully cold all year round. However, this has led to rapid progress in our ability to control our environs.

TEXT_AKTKLA402_04154_HINAGESHI_000_010 -- I've made a list of a few Hannish staples we require to emulate life in Radzâ€“atâ€“Han, and, well...there are certainly quite a few things you would struggle to procure here in Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKLA402_04154_HINAGESHI_000_050 -- Most colorful, would you not agree? Alas, one would surely freeze to death wearing these clothes in Sharlayan for very long...

TEXT_AKTKLA403_04155_TANKIN_000_026 -- But the winds of change blow fiercely now, and there may soon come a day when they seek shelter here in Sharlayan. Knowing they cannot manipulate aether as we do, I wish to better understand their culture should we need to play the hospitable host.

TEXT_AKTKLA403_04155_HINAGESHI_000_027 -- Now I feel like a fool for thinking you were only pursuing this project to improve the lives of those who presently call Sharlayan home. Such genius!

TEXT_AKTKLA403_04155_HINAGESHI_000_070 -- I must say I'm warming up to these cozy clothes and magitek heaters. All of this would definitely improve life in Sharlayan!

TEXT_AKTKLA405_04157_TANKIN_000_048 -- A fortress most formidable. This may be an island like Sharlayan, but it is quite clear our cultures are as night and day.

TEXT_AKTKLA405_04157_TANKIN_000_165 -- ...Alas, the time has come for us to return to Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKLA406_04158_HINAGESHI_000_010 -- You know, on our return voyage to Sharlayan, the professor said he'd been duly inspired and eager to continue our work. What culture do you suppose he intends to study next?

TEXT_AKTKLA501_04160_TLAQATIA_000_048 -- Thank you! Oh, thank you! You are a shining beacon of hope for all young scholars here in Sharlayan!

TEXT_AKTKLA505_04164_AUBRACIE_000_041 -- As for the whale, the Studium has already announced that it will be dispatching a vessel to research the aether currents in the seas near Sharlayan. It won't benefit any of us if such incidents continue to occur, after all.

TEXT_AKTKLA505_04164_TLAQATIA_100_062 -- Be glad you weren't here to see me immediately after I arrived. It was even...less pretty a sight than what you witnessed at the aetheryte plaza back in Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKLA505_04164_TLAQATIA_000_084 -- If we were to analyze them and find them in a similar aetheric state as the whale in Sharlayan, we could safely conclude that both events were caused by the sameâ”€or at least, a similarâ”€phenomenon.

TEXT_AKTKLZ000_04473_QIHALIAPOH_000_004 -- As I'm sure you are aware, the Studium is the most prestigious educational institution in all of Sharlayan. As such, we make a point of only working with the best educators and students.

TEXT_AKTKLZ001_04474_MONTICHAIGNE_000_303 -- I should certainly hope so! Sharlayan is known as a great seat of knowledge, and the Studium is the foremost of its many academies.

TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_SEQ_01 -- Alphinaud calls the Scions to a meeting in Dawn's Respite that they might review what they know of the Telophoroi and their ominous towers. Events in Garlemald reinforce their suspicions that the onslaught of lunar primals is only a precursor to a far more deadly crisisâ”€a crisis which must be stopped at any cost. As you ponder your options, Tataru interrupts the gathering to bring word from Krile that you may now journey unto Sharlayan, as well as instructions to make all haste to the docks in Limsa Lominsa.

TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_SEQ_02 -- After an emotional farewell, you board the ship bound for Sharlayan. At sea you are greeted by a most unexpected visitor, Hydaelyn, who confirms some of what you know, and hints at more that you do not. Her weighty words still echo in your mind as the famous city of scholars appears on the horizon...

TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_SEQ_03 -- Your entry into Sharlayan is not as smooth as you had hoped, but the timely arrival of Krile and her convincing arguments is enough to assuage the immigration officer's suspicions. Nevertheless, you deem it wise to move some distance away from the bureaucrat before you discuss the delicate matters at hand.

TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_GRAHATIA_000_018 -- We will find a way in Sharlayan, I am sure of it.

TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_TATARU_000_022 -- You're to head to Limsa Lominsa and board the next ship bound for Sharlayan...

TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_ALISAIE_000_040 -- What a grim reason to bring you to Sharlayan. Not much to be done about it, I suppose, but I would've liked to give you the grand tour under happier circumstances.

TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_THANCRED_000_045 -- Contrary to what you might think, this will be like going home for me as well. I may have learned how to survive in Limsa Lominsa, but it was in Sharlayan where I was taughtâ”€quite relentlessly, I might addâ”€the skills to properly <Emphasis>live</Emphasis>.

TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_YSHTOLA_000_055 -- I might have lived in Master Matoya's cave for a good part of my life, but even for me, the thought of â€œreturningâ€� to Sharlayan is quite exciting. I can hardly imagine how it is for the others who lived most of their lives there.

TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_TATARU_000_071 -- The ship for Sharlayan should be pulling into port soon, so please follow me and have all your luggage close at hand!

TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_GRAHATIA_000_115 -- Here we are at lastâ”€the great city of Sharlayan! You may have noticed some similarities with the Crystarium, yes? In fact, Iâ”€

TEXT_AKTKMA101_04357_Q2_000_126 -- Travel to Old Sharlayan?

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_GRAHATIA_000_025 -- Here we are at lastâ”€the great city of Sharlayan! You may have noticed some similarities with the Crystarium, yes? In fact, Iâ”€

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_KRILE_000_041 -- But this is <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and Estinien's first time in Sharlayanâ”€and for the rest of you, a homecoming that was long overdue.

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_GRAHATIA_000_056 -- Come, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Sharlayan awaits!

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_GRAHATIA_000_095 -- Ah, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>! Shall we return to our exploration of Sharlayan?

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_GRAHATIA_000_137 -- I look forward to the day your name is celebrated in Sharlayan the same way it is in Eorzea!

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_KRILE_000_141 -- You'll find the usual necessities for daily living and other imports vital to running an island nation, but also supplies that further Sharlayan's pursuit of knowledgeâ”€namely, large quantities of books, specimens, and samples. Sorting these stacks certainly seems to keep the attendants busy.

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_KRILE_000_151 -- As you know, the Sharlayan people prize the accumulation of wisdom above all else. Thus when Thaliak was chosen as our patron deity, it was more a matter of pragmatism than beliefâ”€an alignment of principles, as it were.

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_KRILE_000_152 -- We may have honored Him with a rather impressive sculpture, yes, but our faith is not so restrictive as that of, say, the Ishgardians. Individual Sharlayans canâ”€and do!â”€worship the divinities of their choosing.

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_KRILE_000_171 -- I may have mentioned this before, but although our research into nutrition and food preparation is quite extensive, the average Sharlayan tends to regard seasoning and flavor with...a certain indifference.

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_KRILE_000_174 -- And so the Last Stand came to be. It is, as the name implies, the sole dedicated outpost of fine dining in Sharlayan. The one and only bastion of the culinary arts in an isle of otherwise mediocre fare.

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_KRILE_000_176 -- Because you were a typical Sharlayan when it came to â€œcheap and convenient,â€� Raha. But surely Tataru has since taught you how to appreciate a well-prepared dish! We should all stop in when time permits, and sample the cafÃ©'s delights!

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_KRILE_000_192 -- Now, being the diligent tour guide that I am, I should make mention of the Confluenceâ”€a research facility located on this very plaza. Its much-vaunted discoveries are the reason Sharlayan stands at the forefront of teleportation technology.

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_KRILE_000_194 -- ...And off we go to our next destination! Our path leads northeast to the Agora, Sharlayan's largest marketplace.

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_KRILE_000_230 -- These little open-air book stalls are so uniquely Sharlayan. I'd always thought them a common sight until I visited other nations.

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_KRILE_000_240 -- Welcome to the Agora, where you can find wares made in Sharlayan, as well as a wide selection of imported goods.

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_KRILE_000_261 -- The district we're passing through is called Archons' Designâ”€a name which honors the seven individuals whose contributions were instrumental in the founding of Sharlayan. It is the city's political and financial center, and it also hosts a collection of research institutions.

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_GRAHATIA_000_265 -- These little decorative features are typical of Sharlayan architecture. Aside from the research wing, our headquarters on the Isle of Val were rather simple and rustic by comparison.

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_KRILE_000_271 -- For Sharlayans, water represents more than a life-sustaining liquidâ”€it is a reminder of the great flood which precipitated the birth of our nation, as well as a symbol of the knowledge which flows from Thaliak's divine ewer.

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_GRAHATIA_000_286 -- Naturally, my answers were all inspired by my knowledge of the finest settlement I could think ofâ”€the great city of Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_GRAHATIA_000_291 -- This neighborhood is home to the highest echelons of Sharlayan society. I never did feel comfortable enough to wander these streets on a whim.

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_KRILE_000_301 -- In the present day, it serves as the residential district for the most important officials and the oldest Sharlayan families.

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_KRILE_000_303 -- And with that, we bring our little Sharlayan tour to a close. I hope it has proven to be an entertaining and enlightening experience!

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_KRILE_000_330 -- Sharlayan is full of educational and research institutions, but there are still professors who prefer to establish their own private practices.

TEXT_AKTKMA102_04358_KRILE_000_355 -- This place is like a second home for the Students... The Isle of Val served as our main headquarters, of course, but we often had occasion to visit Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_SEQ_01 -- As a means to gain insight into the Forum and their confounding obstinacy, Krile has been scouring Sharlayan's archives for any mention of the Final Days. Progress has been slow, however, and she enlists you and your fellow Scions to help with her research. For your first task, you are to meet Krile at the nearby entrance to Noumenonâ”€the grand library of Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_SEQ_02 -- Krile instructs you to seek out any books on the subject of Sharlayan history or the workings of the Forum. It seems she wishes for you to brush up on your fundamental knowledge for the sake of the ongoing investigation.

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_SEQ_03 -- Having reviewed the basics of Sharlayan's founding and the establishment of the Forum, you feel sufficiently prepared for the task ahead. You then recall that you were to rendezvous with the others at the stone benches just outside Noumenon's entrance.

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_KRILE_000_020 -- An unsettling change has come over Sharlayan, but together we will divine the underlying cause for the Forum's callousness.

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_KRILE_000_022 -- Which is why I began scouring Sharlayan's archive of historical records for any hint of a connection to the Final Days.

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_KRILE_000_030 -- My directions were easy enough to follow, I hope? In any case, you stand now before the doors of Noumenon, Sharlayan's grandest collection of books and tomes!

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_KRILE_000_032 -- Any citizen of Sharlayan is free to enter and peruse its shelves. ...Well, most of its shelves. Only Archons are afforded access to certain restricted vaults.

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_KRILE_000_034 -- Your status presents more of a problem. As a non-citizen, you are only permitted to browse the first floor here at the entrance. Even so, there should be a number of books which touch upon Sharlayan history or Forum policy.

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_SYSTEM_000_048 -- This book is on the wrong subject. Search for works which contain details on the Forum, or mention the history of Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_BOOKTWO_000_050 -- (-<Emphasis>The Voice of a Growing City</Emphasis>-)<Emphasis>In the years which followed the founding of Sharlayan, civic policy and other matters of import were decided at the Ecclesiaâ”€a public forum at which every citizen was eligible to speak.</Emphasis>

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_BOOKTWO_000_052 -- (-<Emphasis>The Voice of a Growing City</Emphasis>-)<Emphasis>Various measures were introduced in an attempt to curtail protracted discussions, but in the year 201 of the Sixth Astral Era, it was ultimately decreed that Sharlayan would transition to a new form of governance.</Emphasis>

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_SYSTEM_000_054 -- You have gained a fundamental understanding of Sharlayan history and the foundation of the Forum. Head outside to the rendezvous point and await your companions.

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_BOOKTHREE_000_056 -- (-<Emphasis>Stewards of Wisdom</Emphasis>-)<Emphasis>During the chaos of the Sixth Umbral Calamity, Archon Nyunkrepf, founder of Sharlayan, bore witness to the madness and savagery of men brought to the brink of despair. Upon raising a settlement on an island in the Northern Empty, he instructed his people thus:</Emphasis>

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_BOOKTHREE_000_058 -- (-<Emphasis>Stewards of Wisdom</Emphasis>-)<Emphasis>The Sharlayans took to heart the words of their savior, and thenceforth served as stewards of wisdom.</Emphasis>

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_BOOKTHREE_000_062 -- (-<Emphasis>Stewards of Wisdom</Emphasis>-)<Emphasis>And so it was that no matter the trials and tribulations of the age, the citizens of Sharlayan would live by their founder's teachings. For the sake of a better tomorrowâ”€for the sake of a brighter starâ”€they would eschew the tools of war, and with knowledge deliver the world.</Emphasis>

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_Q5_000_071 -- The title on the spine reads <Emphasis>The Story of Sharlayan</Emphasis>.
Read the book?

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_BOOKFIVE_000_072 -- (-<Emphasis>The Story of Sharlayan</Emphasis>-)<Emphasis>Long, long ago, on an island in the northern sea, there lived a Roegadyn man by the name of Nyunkrepf.</Emphasis>

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_BOOKFIVE_000_073 -- (-<Emphasis>The Story of Sharlayan</Emphasis>-)<Emphasis>Nyunkrepf was a student of astrology, and he divined that a flood of terrifying proportions would soon sweep over the lands of Eorzea.</Emphasis>

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_BOOKFIVE_000_074 -- (-<Emphasis>The Story of Sharlayan</Emphasis>-)<Emphasis>So it was that he built a gigantic ship, assembled a crew, and set sail for that imperiled realm.</Emphasis>

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_BOOKFIVE_000_075 -- (-<Emphasis>The Story of Sharlayan</Emphasis>-)<Emphasis>The flood arrived as foretold, and to their horror the strangely churning waters drove the people towards the ocean. It was there, however, that Nyunkrepf's crew hauled them aboard his ark, but the danger had not passed: a towering wave approached, threatening to smash the vessel to pieces!</Emphasis>

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_BOOKFIVE_000_076 -- (-<Emphasis>The Story of Sharlayan</Emphasis>-)<Emphasis>With only moments to spare, Nyunkrepf wove a mighty spell of teleportation, and shifted the entire ship to safety atop Abalathia's Spine.</Emphasis>

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_BOOKFIVE_000_077 -- (-<Emphasis>The Story of Sharlayan</Emphasis>-)<Emphasis>Refugees from the surrounding regions huddled there alongside them, but it was not long before disputes over the dwindling supply of food led to violence and bloodshed.</Emphasis>

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_BOOKFIVE_000_078 -- (-<Emphasis>The Story of Sharlayan</Emphasis>-)<Emphasis>Saddened by the sight, Nyunkrepf gathered to him his crew and his grateful passengers, and abandoned the ark to those reddened peaks. They journeyed to the coast where they built a new ship, intent upon returning to the northern seas.</Emphasis>

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_BOOKFIVE_000_079 -- (-<Emphasis>The Story of Sharlayan</Emphasis>-)<Emphasis>They landed on the beach of an island, and settled upon that very spot. That settlement prospered and grew, and in time it became the city of Sharlayan we live in to this day.</Emphasis>

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_BOOKSIX_000_081 -- (-<Emphasis>Roads of Old: The Colony</Emphasis>-)<Emphasis>Many years ago, on the banks of the Thaliak in the Dravanian hinterlands, a Sharlayan colony once thrived.</Emphasis>

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_BOOKSIX_000_084 -- (-<Emphasis>Roads of Old: The Colony</Emphasis>-)<Emphasis>As rumors spread of a growing community of academics, the area was further inundated with Eorzean students hoping to share in the renowned wisdom of the Sharlayans.</Emphasis>

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_BOOKSIX_000_085 -- (-<Emphasis>Roads of Old: The Colony</Emphasis>-)<Emphasis>Fifty years later, the Forum passed a motion to recognize what had become a flourishing town as an official Sharlayan colony.</Emphasis>

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_BOOKSIX_000_086 -- (-<Emphasis>Roads of Old: The Colony</Emphasis>-)<Emphasis>Eorzean residents took to calling the colony itself â€œSharlayan,â€� which led to no small amount of confusion when discussions turned to the subject of the motherland.</Emphasis>

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_BOOKSIX_000_087 -- (-<Emphasis>Roads of Old: The Colony</Emphasis>-)<Emphasis>In response, some Sharlayan inhabitants, if pressed for a name, would simply refer to it as â€œEmporium.â€�</Emphasis>

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_SYSTEM_000_089 -- The following chapters go on to introduce the most prominent features of Idyllshire. This book does not appear to contain additional information on the Forum, or cover the history of the Sharlayan motherland in greater detail.

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_ALISAIE_000_098 -- It seems our dear father has instructed the staff that even if Alphinaud and I were to return to Sharlayan, we were not to be allowed across the threshold.

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_GRAHATIA_000_102 -- Ah, well... My situation is also somewhat complicated. I was raised in Sharlayan, yes, but I was born rather further away.

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_GRAHATIA_000_113 -- As the last child born with the Allagan Eye, I was given over to the custody of friends in the Students of Baldesion, who had me registered as a Sharlayan citizen.

TEXT_AKTKMA103_04359_GRAHATIA_000_115 -- Even Thancred was taken in by Archon Louisoix, was he not? Stories of adopted waifs and rescued orphans are more common among Sharlayans than you might think.

TEXT_AKTKMA104_04360_ALISAIE_000_010 -- As busy as ever, I see. How very Sharlayan that no other gourmet cafÃ© has sprung up to compete for customers...

TEXT_AKTKMA104_04360_ALISAIE_000_099 -- We have questions, and only Sharlayan has the answers. Tell me, Master Dickon: have you heard anything about an apocalypse called the Final Days?

TEXT_AKTKMA104_04360_DICKON_000_103 -- Hm, but maybe there is. You're a visitor to Sharlayan, aren't you?

TEXT_AKTKMA104_04360_SMITUTIA_000_177 -- Hm? You don't know what a gleaner is? They're...collectors, of a sort. Travel the world procuring things that we haven't got here in Sharlayanâ”€priceless books, unusual live specimens, and so forth.

TEXT_AKTKMA105_04361_ALPHINAUD_000_036 -- Coupled with what <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> and Alisaie learned at the Last Stand, we can be reasonably sure that most Sharlayans know nothing of that particular period of ancient history.

TEXT_AKTKMA106_04362_YSHTOLA_000_125 -- This is the foremost material archive in Sharlayan. I should love to explore its treasures shelf by shelf, but I fear we have little time for such indulgences.

TEXT_AKTKMA106_04362_ALPHINAUD_000_140 -- Behold, the Archeion. As Noumenon serves as Sharlayan's literary archive, so does this structure house the city's wealth of material data.

TEXT_AKTKMA106_04362_ALPHINAUD_000_143 -- In a manner of speaking, the Archeion contains a physical history of Sharlayan's unwavering dedication to the accumulation of knowledge.

TEXT_AKTKMA107_04363_YSHTOLA_000_005 -- This is the foremost material archive in Sharlayan. I should love to explore its treasures shelf by shelf, but I fear we have little time for such indulgences.

TEXT_AKTKMA109_04365_ALPHINAUD_000_172 -- Sharlayan has been called to action, and the Telophoroi's declaration was the catalyst. Whatever charge it is they hope to fulfill, they deem it of sufficient import to disrupt all of Labyrinthos, not to mention ignore Eorzea's request for aid...

TEXT_AKTKMA110_04366_SEQ_03 -- You find Krile by a patch of unusual flowers, and the reason behind her odd behavior finally becomes clear. It seems the headaches were a result of Hydaelyn attempting to make contact with one of Her chosen. Krile hands you a heartbloom, then relinquishes control of her body to the primal that She might deliver to you a message: â€œIn darkness seek joy. Surrender not to sadness, and see beyond despair. Walk free, and bear the light for others to follow.â€�

Still contemplating Hydaelyn's cryptic words, you hear voices raised in protest further down the hill. Fourchenault, it seems, has caught wind of your investigations, and you are taken to the Rostra to stand trial at the Forum's inquiry. Though your colleagues seize the opportunity to confront Sharlayan's leadership with what they have recently learned, they succeed only in confirming that Fourchenault and the others are bound to a duty they cannot ignoreâ”€and that said duty is connected to a discovery made in the course of studies of the aetherial sea. The assembly concludes with a vote on a proposal allowing the Scions to remain in Sharlayan on the condition that you cease all efforts to discover the nature of the nation's â€œmomentous duty.â€� The proposal is passed, and so you will not be expelled from the city...for now.

TEXT_AKTKMA110_04366_YSHTOLA_000_062 -- With our freedoms so sorely curtailed, however, we will struggle to learn aught more of substance here in Sharlayan...

TEXT_AKTKMA112_04368_SEQ_02 -- Welcoming you excitedly as â€œtest subjects,â€� Kytte informs you that a new kind of aetheryte has been created that does not require attunement, and that the first pair of prototypes have been installed in Old Sharlayan and Yedlihmad, a port town in Thavnair. Once your preparations are in order, you are to join her at the aetheryte plaza for your journey.

TEXT_AKTKMA112_04368_SEQ_04 -- No sooner do you emerge in the balmy heat of Thavnair than you are taken by a debilitating wave of the promised sickness. Only Estinien, who had been to the island prior and teleported the tried and trusted way, emerges unscathed. Seeing the state of you and the others, he goes off alone to procure drinks for his ailing comradesâ”€much to Thancred's dismay. Though your stomach roils fiercely at the slightest provocation, the others appear to be faring worse, and so it falls to you to find Estinien before his aggressive indifference to concepts like â€œbudgetsâ€� and â€œcrippling debtâ€� lead to a costly mistake.

â€»In the event that you leave the area and wish to return, speak with Kytte in Old Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKMA112_04368_TODO_01 -- Wait at the aetheryte plaza in Old Sharlayan.

TEXT_AKTKMA120_04376_SEQ_02 -- Varshahn guides you through the city to Meghaduta, the satrap's residence, where you come face-to-face with the man himself, Ahewann. Not to be fooled, however, Estinien demands an end to the charade, and so does the true ruler of Radzâ€“atâ€“Han reveal himself: the great wyrm Vrtra, youngest of the first brood. The people of Ahewann's line have long posed as the satrap, while Varshahn, like other attendants before him, is a simulacrum created to serve as a vessel for the wyrm's will. The true history of Thavnair thus brought to light, Vrtra puts forth a proposal: if the Scions will agree to lead an assault on the Tower of Zot, he will provide them with more warding scales to shield them from its corruption. Though the offer is undeniably attractive, help will likely be required if you are to succeed in the mission, and it is decided that you will return to Sharlayan to confer with the rest of your order.

TEXT_AKTKMA120_04376_SEQ_03 -- Though the meeting took an unexpected turn, you now have a clear objective ahead of you. Having given everyone a friendly reminder to attune to the local aetheryte, Thancred sets off back to Sharlayan, and you and the others follow.

TEXT_AKTKMA121_04377_SEQ_01 -- In the Baldesion Annex, you and your fellow Scions gather to share the findings of your investigations in Sharlayan and Radzâ€“atâ€“Han. Krile is of the opinion that assaulting the Tower of Zot should be the highest priority, and having conceived of a strategy, the party sets forth for Thavnair. Upon arriving on the island, you are to first regroup at the outpost at the Hamsa Hatchery.

TEXT_AKTKMB101_04380_ALISAIE_000_045 -- See that sculpted pitcher above the entrance? That's the mark of Thaliak, the Scholar. Bearer of the waters of knowledge. It's no exaggeration to say that Sharlayan itself is one enormous shrine to Him, and that's especially noticeable here in the Studium.

TEXT_AKTKMB102_04381_MERLWYB_000_078 -- During your time in Sharlayan, the allied nations have been engaged on separate fronts, with no end in sight.

TEXT_AKTKMB103_04382_GRAHATIA_000_200 -- Since my â€œrevival,â€� I've been lax in expanding my limited wardrobe. Think we have time for a quick trip back to Old Sharlayan? I recall a rather fetching coat...

TEXT_AKTKMD109_04417_SEQ_06 -- As the citizens congregate before Meghaduta, Vrtra descends from the sky and reveals unto them his secret, thus fulfilling Ahewann's deepest wish and ending the long deception surrounding the satrap's true identity. The great wyrm's words resonate with the people, overcoming their initial surprise and skepticism, and give them hope for Radzâ€“atâ€“Han's future. This historic moment, however, is soon interrupted when Fourchenault and his colleagues from the Sharlayan Forum arrive with shocking news and an even more shocking proposal. The star they live upon is dying, and he would assist the people in escaping it to take refuge on the moon. Sharing his people's deep and abiding love for their home, Vrtra promises he will make no decision that binds them, and retreats with his guests to discuss the matter in private. Not moments after the wyrm and the Sharlayans have taken their leave, Nidhana reappears to share with you her latest theory that a force other than aether empowers the blasphemies and beastsâ”€namely, an energy called akasa, said to be influenced by emotion alone. You ponder the implications of this potential explanation as Nidhana takes her leave and the congregated citizenry go their separate ways.

TEXT_AKTKMD109_04417_THANCRED_000_175 -- Their solution sits ill with me. But if life has taught me anything, it's that there is little to be gained from arguing with Sharlayans. We must take it upon ourselves to find a better way.

TEXT_AKTKMF105_04443_URIANGER_000_021 -- Given the similarities betwixt this artificial environment and Bestways Burrow, 'twould be in our best interests to have the Loporrits acquaint themselves with those conditions deemed optimal by their Sharlayan collaborators.

TEXT_AKTKMF107_04445_SEQ_01 -- With all Loporrits present and accounted for, Urianger insists that the group return to Sharlayan Hamlet, so as to be ready when the time comes to take flight. Seeing the wisdom in this, they reluctantly agree, despite their niggling curiosity about every aspect of Etheirys.

TEXT_AKTKMF107_04445_SEQ_04 -- You speak with a number of Sharlayan Hamlet's residents, who show varying degrees of distress over the impending crisis. Those who stand to find reassurance in the Loporrits' experience are sent to Urianger, to be paired with appropriate members of the delegation.

TEXT_AKTKMF107_04445_SEQ_06 -- Thanks to Urianger's skill in pairing the right Loporrit with the right person, many are soon joyfully engaged in conversation with Sharlayans. To his surprise, however, the next to arrive seeking assistance are Wilfsunn and Bloewydaâ”€father and mother to none other than the dearly departed Moenbryda. Overcome by emotion, Urianger has naught but stammered apologies to offer them at first, though it soon transpires that they do not blame him in the least for their daughter's death, and have in fact been worrying over him much as they would their own child since they fell out of touch. At last, Urianger tearfully accepts Bloewyda's embrace, and affirms that he can feel Moenbryda's spirit with him, even now.

Unfortunately, they have found little success since the Calamity weakened Her power, so you will be required to dive deeper than the Sharlayans ever dared if you would seek Her out. There, Fourchenault warns, drift memories strong enough to have escaped purgation by the cleansing tides, which may attempt to bar your path in death as they did in life...

TEXT_GAIUSE414_00082_SEQ_01 -- It would seem that Minfilia's claims of progress on the matter of finding a way into Iceheart's sanctuary are somewhat premature. After a lengthy discussion with Urianger, the Antecedent has concluded that the Scions in Revenant's Toll lack the expertise to develop a solution and must therefore turn to another for assistanceâ”€a Sharlayan colleague who is currently en route to Mor Dhona. Minfilia invites you to accompany her to the northern gates, where she intends to greet the newcomer's arrival.

TEXT_GAIUSE414_00082_SEQ_02 -- While you and Minfilia converse upon matters deep and profound, a carriage arrives in Revenant's Toll. A tall Roegadyn woman disembarks from it, whom Minfilia introduces to you as Moenbryda, an accomplished Sharlayan scholar and an authority on aetheryte technologies. Now that your new colleague has arrived, it would seem a good time to trouble Minfilia for a plan of action.

TEXT_GAIUSE414_00082_MINFILIA_000_005 -- ...Which is why we have called upon the aid of one who <Emphasis>does</Emphasis> possess such expertiseâ”€a colleague of ours who is currently en route to Revenant's Toll from Sharlayan. She should be arriving within the hour, in fact.

TEXT_GAIUSE507_00369_MINFILIA_000_051 -- We shall gather in the Sharlayan manner to celebrate Moenbryda's life...and mourn her passing.

TEXT_GAIUSE508_00429_SEQ_01 -- Wishing to hold a simple service to honor the fallen Moenbryda, Minfilia suggests a gathering at the nearby monumentâ”€a stone sacred to Thaliak, the guardian deity of Sharlayan. Travel to Rathefrost in Mor Dhona, and wait at the mark of the Scholar for the other Scions to arrive.

TEXT_GAIUSE508_00429_MINFILIA_000_002 -- As Moenbryda was a native of Sharlayan, I feel it is only fitting that we gather before the mark of the Scholar. Are you familiar with the stone?

TEXT_HEAVNA325_01626_ALPHINAUD_000_016 -- I was born the pampered son of a Sharlayan dignitary, and, alongside my twin, became the youngest student ever to be accepted into the Studium.

TEXT_HEAVNA605_01654_SEQ_01 -- According to Y'shtola, Matoya has been living as a hermit on the fringes of Sharlayan, in the Dravanian hinterlands. The journey will take you west through the Dravanian forelands. In order to prepare, Alphinaud suggests that you first return to Ishgard. Make your way back to the Holy See, and rejoin your comrades at the aetheryte plaza.

TEXT_HEAVNA605_01654_SEQ_02 -- It is decided that you and Alphinaud will accompany Y'shtola on the expedition to Sharlayan. The first leg of your journey will take you to the settlement of Tailfeather.

TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_SEQ_01 -- The Dravanian hinterlands lie west of Tailfeather, and getting there requires that you travel through Gnath-held territory. Proceed with caution as you continue on your way to Sharlayan.

TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_SEQ_03 -- As you make your way through the ruins of Sharlayan, you encounter a band of goblins. The confrontation threatens to turn violent, but Alphinaud manages to defuse the situation by convincing the goblin leader, Slowfix, that your purpose is peaceful. In an abrupt change of tone, Slowfix offers to take you on a tour. Follow the goblin to the heart of the settlement and speak with him there.

TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_SEQ_04 -- You learn that the goblins mean to found a new nation here in Sharlayan, aided by treasure hunters who have come seeking the city's artifacts. In exchange for passage through the settlement, Slowfix asks that you help the denizens of Idyllshire with the myriad problems they face. For want of an alternate way to cross the Thaliak River, you decide to oblige the goblin.

TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_YSHTOLA_000_000 -- I believe I am sufficiently rested. Let us continue west to Sharlayan.

TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_ALPHINAUD_000_013 -- But fifteen years abandoned, and already Sharlayan has fallen into such disarray... Verily, a city is no more than its inhabitants.

TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_YSHTOLA_000_020 -- â€œKnowledge Seeks No Manâ€�... So says the motto of Sharlayan engraved upon yonder stone. The meaning is simple: it falls to us to seek enlightenment.

TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_YSHTOLA_000_021 -- During the Sixth Astral Era, at the turn of the thirteenth century, men from the northern nation of Sharlayan journeyed across the seas to Eorzea in search of knowledge.

TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_YSHTOLA_000_023 -- Alas, those glory days are now but a fading memory. With her keepers lost to her, Sharlayan has become an empty husk of her former self.

TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_SLOWFIX_000_024 -- (-???-)Pshkohhh... Uplander is mistaken. Sharlayan has new keepers, is on cusp of new age of glory!

TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_YSHTOLA_000_047 -- So that is what happened after we Sharlayans departed...

TEXT_HEAVNA606_01655_YSHTOLA_000_052 -- I suppose it's only to be expected that others would come and occupy Sharlayan. Nonetheless, it feels akin to having strangers take over your home in your absence.

TEXT_HEAVNA607_01656_SEQ_01 -- Golem sentinels left by the Sharlayans are hampering Slowfix's plans for expanding Idyllshire, and the goblin asks that you eliminate them. As a native of Sharlayan, Y'shtola may know an easy way to deal with the creatures.

TEXT_HEAVNA607_01656_SLOWFIX_000_002 -- Uplanders are Sharlayan, yes? Sharlayans should know best way to deal with creatures.

TEXT_HEAVNA607_01656_SLOWFIX_000_003 -- Slowfix wants uplanders to eliminate golems. Uplanders are Sharlayan, yes? Sharlayans should know best way to deal with creatures.

TEXT_HEAVNA607_01656_YSHTOLA_000_005 -- I suppose it's only to be expected that others would come and occupy Sharlayan. Nonetheless, it feels akin to having strangers take over your home in your absence.

TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_ALPHINAUD_000_003 -- At the Studium, I had the good fortune to be tutored by some of the finest scholars in Sharlayan. I can safely say, however, that Master Matoya exceeds them all. How I should have liked to listen to her arguing with my grandfather...

TEXT_HEAVNA612_01661_ALPHINAUD_000_011 -- Ser Aymeric, I am pleased to see that your recovery proceeds apace. May I introduce Y'shtola, a fellow Scion of the Seventh Dawn and Archon of Sharlayan.

TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_SEQ_01 -- Although there has been progress in the search for F'lhaminn, Yda, and Papalymo, the hunt for Minfilia and Thancred remains at a standstill. Fortunately, it would seem that one of the surviving Students of Baldesion is coming to aid you in your efforts. As much as he would like to stay and greet the Sharlayan scholar, Alphinaudâ”€and youâ”€have been summoned for a private audience with Ser Aymeric to discuss an undisclosed matter. Attend the lord commander at the Congregation of Our Knights Most Heavenly forthwith.

TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_SEQ_04 -- Tataru is heartened to learn of your diplomatic mission, and readily concedes that it should take precedence over receiving the Sharlayan scholar. Even so, she encourages you to join the welcoming party in Idyllshire should time permit, as the Sharlayan scholar in question is not just <Emphasis>anyone</Emphasis>... Before she can elaborate, however, Alphinaud loudly declares that you must return to the Congregation at once. Apparently, the first commander has been kept waiting long enough.

TEXT_HEAVNB101_02156_TATARU_000_009 -- ...I'm afraid I have nothing new to share about those two. But it's not all doom and gloom! The good news is, we've enlisted the services of a Sharlayan scholarâ”€one of the Students of Baldesionâ”€to aid in the search, who should be arriving any day now!

TEXT_HEAVNB102_02157_SEQ_04 -- While it remains to be seen if your diplomatic efforts will bear fruit, your companions agree that the meeting went as well as could be expected, given the circumstances. Your business in Anyx Trine thus concluded, you bid farewell to Lucia so that you may continue west to Sharlayan and join Y'shtola in welcoming the visiting scholar.

TEXT_HEAVNB102_02157_ALPHINAUD_000_073 -- Well, if you have no further need of our services, we shall continue on to Sharlayan. We hope to welcome a scholar who has agreed to aid us in the search for our missing comrades.

TEXT_HEAVNB103_02158_SEQ_00 -- Alphinaud is eager to set out for Sharlayan.

TEXT_HEAVNB103_02158_SEQ_01 -- Alphinaud is curious to know how the Sharlayan scholar will help you to locate Minfilia and Thancred. Happily, all should be revealed soon enough.

TEXT_HEAVNB103_02158_SEQ_02 -- After yet another remarkably uneventful journey, you rendezvous with Y'shtola, who informs you that the Sharlayan scholar arrived safely and is presently exploring the wilderness outside Idyllshire. She should be returning to Frontbridge at any momentâ”€you need but wait there to meet her.

TEXT_HEAVNB103_02158_ALPHINAUD_000_032 -- What of our Sharlayan guest? Has she arrived yet?

TEXT_HEAVNC102_02232_SEQ_02 -- You learn that after concluding their investigation in the Praetorium, Krile and Thancred journeyed to the Sil'dih Aqueducts, where Minfilia was last seen. Apparently, the readings from these two locations yielded a unique aetheric signatureâ”€one which was also detected at the Isle of Val, where Krile claims she was shielded by the blessing of Light. The conclusion is clear: Hydaelyn's intercessions can be measured and traced. Furthermore, Krile states that not two but three people were caught in Y'shtola's Flow. Unlike the Archons, however, the third individual appears to have vanished without a trace. Though it is something of a logical leap, Krile surmises that Hydaelynâ”€who has a demonstrated capacity to summon the consciousness of those blessed with the Echo to Her realmâ”€may have guided Minfilia into the teleportation magick's compass, and thence summoned her, body and soul, unto the aetherial sea. Should this be the case, then the search must continue in that near-mythical place. Fortunately, it would seem that the Sharlayans built a structure to study the aetherial sea, and that its custodian yet remains, in defiance of the exodus...

TEXT_HEAVNC102_02232_SEQ_03 -- All things come at a price, and Matoya's permission is no different. Although she grants you and Thancred access to the Antitower, she demands that the others stay behind and assist her with various chores. You are soon denied even the bard's company, however, when Y'shtola forbids him from entering the tower, for fear of how he might be affected by the swirling aether within. And so it falls to you to explore the Sharlayan structure aloneâ”€or with some few of your fellow adventurers if you must, Matoya being a charitable sort.

â€»The Antitower can be accessed via the Duty Finder.

TEXT_HEAVNC102_02232_YSHTOLA_000_052 -- I speak of the Antitowerâ”€a Sharlayan construction conceived to provide scholars a vantage point over the aetherial sea.

TEXT_HEAVNF104_02354_THANCRED_000_065 -- I am no ninja, but I did spend some few moons in the Sharlayan homeland learning how to move unseen. Between Yugiri and my humble self, Yda and Papalymo will be well protected.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_YSHTOLA_000_005 -- Yet it is no mere forgotten contrivance of Sharlayan. The resultant aetheric disturbance confirms that it is a primal, and that it was summoned amidst the ruins left for the river to reclaim.

TEXT_HEAVNR101_02090_CID_000_055 -- Quite how they managed to coax a primal into the hulk of a Sharlayan defense mechanism I don't know, but it looks like they've made themselves a tidy little fortress inside the colossus.

TEXT_HEAVNR105_02094_MIDE_000_512 -- Wait. What do you mean â€œbeforeâ€�? Roundroxâ”€were you near the Sharlayan ruins when...when the metal giant first appeared?

TEXT_HEAVNR201_02249_BACKRIX_000_070 -- Pssshkoh... Questions of codex's true nature niggle at Backrix's braincase. He is sure something is missing from data, so turns to Sharlayan book for answers.

TEXT_HEAVNR201_02249_BACKRIX_000_624 -- Pssshkoh... Such was question Backrix asked himself. So he spends much time gathering knowings, and finds answer in book lent to him by Sharlayan uplander.

TEXT_HEAVNR205_02253_WEDGE_000_800 -- Y'shtola and the chief have returned to Matoya's Cave. Don't worry, between them, they're sure to find the answer to our problems. If it isn't waiting on a shelf in the Sharlayan annals, it'll be in some forgotten corner of the chief's brain, you mark my words!

TEXT_HEAVNR305_02339_SEQ_03 -- Backrix's eyes light up at the sight of the tome, which he explains is a Sharlayan book of legends he had requested of Y'shtola. He reads from a chapter containing the legends of the Hotgo, a tribe of blue-haired Au Ra. According to their myth of creation, the Hotgo trace their ancestry back to two childrenâ”€a boy and a girlâ”€who emerged from the belly of a great steel giant in days of yore. All present are astounded when Backrix further reveals that, according to the legend, the two children were named Dayan and Mide, and that they are said to have emerged from the giant holding a curious black stone that glowed at the touch of a hand. Though you can only speculate as to the wrinkles and twists of time that have brought such implausible events to pass, you can once again look to the future knowing that the primal threat has been subdued, and history set back on its proper course.

TEXT_HEAVNR305_02339_BACKRIX_000_410 -- This... This is Sharlayan legendbook from Y'shtola! Backrix has waited for legendbook for long time!

TEXT_HEAVNY004_02202_SEQ_05 -- Sawney regales Midnight Dew with the tale of your brave foray into the Arboretum, and at last reveals the â€œtreasureâ€� he sought to be the seeds of specially cultivated crops. Midnight Dew hopes to use them to start a new industry in Idyllshire, and thereby free the settlement of its reliance on an ever-diminishing supply of Sharlayan junk. Even as Sawney departs to plant his treasure, you are cordially invited to visit Idyllshire in the near future to sample the bountiful harvest that the seeds will inevitably produce.

TEXT_HEAVNY004_02202_SAWNEY_100_036 -- You see, the â€œtreasureâ€� we were lookin' for was seeds and sprouts that were cultivated specially by the Sharlayans. Years of research went into breedin' 'em, apparently, and they produced plants like you wouldn't believe.

TEXT_HEAVNY004_02202_MIDNIGHTDEW_000_037 -- As of now, Idyllshire's main industry is collectin' the junk left behind by the Sharlayans. But it won't last forever.

TEXT_HEAVNY104_02386_YAYAKE_000_033 -- The Sharlayans built this bastion of erudition and scholarly inquiry that Eorzea might benefit from wisdom compiled through the ages, only to see its treasures gather dust, their pages seen by none but the monstrosities that now haunt its halls. We would see the library restored to its former glory, and ascertaining the full breadth and scope of its contents is a modestâ”€but most necessaryâ”€first step.

TEXT_HEAVNY221_02288_URIANGER_000_053 -- 'Tis passing strange... I wove the ward in accordance with the most closely guarded teachings of the archmages of Sharlayan. Naught was left to chance. Naught.

TEXT_HEAVNZ809_01939_SEQ_03 -- Drydox is very happy to have her sacks back. It transpires that they are filled with artifacts left by the Sharlayans before their exodus, items that can find new use in Idyllshire. It seems thus that you have done your good deed for the day, and contributed to the small settlement's future.

TEXT_HEAVNZ809_01939_DRYDOX_000_022 -- Inside sacks? Inside sacks is junk, uplanderâ”€but not <Emphasis>any</Emphasis> junk! These are forgotten relics of Sharlayan uplanders, and their trash is treasure for gobbies! Idyllshire no need new things, will use these again and again instead!

TEXT_HEAVNZ815_01945_HALFSIX_000_022 -- Uplanders of Sharlayan are making aetherytes to whirl, using tricksy ancient knowings. If gobbieflock uses tools and parts left by old uplanders, then aetheryte of Idyllshire will stay spinning for many, many years!

TEXT_HEAVNZ817_01947_SEQ_03 -- Tapklix is relieved to learn that the hurt dealt his rearâ”€and the injury to his prideâ”€have been avenged. He tells you that monsters came trickling down from the mountains after the Sharlayans left the area, and that he means to see them purged so good folk can live free from fear of attack.

TEXT_HEAVNZ817_01947_TAPKLIX_000_021 -- Many uplanders of Sharlayan leave fifteen years ago, name of the exodus. Wild beasts come down from mountains, make lairs in houses and roosts in rooves. Now, all this is their domain...

TEXT_HEAVNZ832_01962_SEQ_03 -- You walk up the steps, and are greeted by the sight of two Sharlayan mammets, presumably left behind to deter intruders. Though they attack, you repel them with ease, and ensure they will no more trouble travelers. Return to Woolnix's friend, and give him the news.

TEXT_HEAVNZ832_01962_INNEEDGOB01962_000_050 -- Pshkohhh... Uplander has broken monsters? Monsters are not monsters, but mammets of Sharlayan!?

TEXT_HEAVNZ832_01962_INNEEDGOB01962_000_060 -- Mammets of Sharlayan will make great junk, can learn muchly from them.

TEXT_HEAVNZ833_01963_SEQ_01 -- Midnight Dew's entire stock has been stolen by a band of thieves, who have been seen escaping into the Sharlayan ruins. She asks you to assist her in tracking the bandits down, and bids you meet with her in the Answering Quarter to begin the hunt.

She tells you that it is not unusual to see bandits in the hinterlandsâ”€after all, the Sharlayan ruins make perfect hideouts for outlaws on the run from the cityâ€“states of Eorzea. However, this is the first time their criminal avarice has posed an existential threat to Idyllshire itself. Midnight Dew thanks you for your assistance in capturing the criminalsâ”€now that her stock is returned, trade with the goblins can continue and the survival of Idyllshire is secured.

TEXT_HEAVNZ835_01965_MIDNIGHTDEW_000_101 -- Seems there've been more and more bad eggs findin' their way into the hinterlands of late. All the scum of Eorzea float in on the tideâ”€thieves and murderers on the run from the cityâ€“states, lookin' to hide out in the old Sharlayan ruins.

TEXT_HEAVNZ902_01967_SEQ_01 -- The straightforward broom offers to share with you his knowledge, but you must first bring him the object he desires: a signpost for aetherial travel, which he describes as sparkly, glowy, and angularly.

TEXT_JOBAOZ550_03734_GOLDSMITHS03734_000_022 -- Most of them are constructed according to Sharlayan designs, and even the more simplistic configurations are remarkably complex.

TEXT_JOBAOZ550_03734_FYRGEISS_000_026 -- Sharlayan <Emphasis>and</Emphasis> Allagan technology, eh? Fascinating!

TEXT_JOBAST300_02012_SEQ_01 -- Jannequinard has invited you to study with him the many mysteries of the Sharlayan school of astrology.

TEXT_JOBAST300_02012_SEQ_02 -- You speak with Jannequinard and express your interest in his field of study. The astrologian accepts you with open arms and proceeds to give you your first astrology-related assignmentâ”€inquiring with other Athenaeum students on the whereabouts of an important visitant from Sharlayan.

TEXT_JOBAST300_02012_SEQ_04 -- Jannequinard believes Forlemort of the Observatorium may be privy to information regarding the whereabouts of the missing Sharlayan party, and is resolved to make the journey south into the Coerthas central highlands to ask the chief astrologian himself. Jannequinard has requested that you meet him at the astroscope so that he will not have to entreat Forlemort alone.

TEXT_JOBAST300_02012_SEQ_05 -- A series of unpredictable circumstances forced the Sharlayan party to make a long and dangerous detour through the Black Shroud. If Chief Astrologian Forlemort's information is to be believed, the party lingers currently somewhere in the vicinity of Quarrymill. Jannequinard's retainer Quimperain is already en route to the hamlet. Join him in the search.

TEXT_JOBAST300_02012_SEQ_06 -- While Quimperain thanks you for your assistance in helping his master, he ever-so-subtly advises you against continuing your studies in astrology. Follow Quimperain into Snakemolt to commence your search for the Sharlayan party.

TEXT_JOBAST300_02012_JANNEQUINARD_000_004 -- Astrology, or the reading of the stars, is a branch of aetherological science which originated in distant Sharlayan. There have been astrologians in Ishgard for thousands of years, but it wasn't until three centuries ago when Adaunel the Younger learned that the movement of the stars could also be used to foresee the movements of the Dravanian Horde that the field became popular.

TEXT_JOBAST300_02012_JANNEQUINARD_000_005 -- Since then, what was once a single science has bifurcated into two similar yet ultimately different schools of learning: the Sharlayan school of astrology and the Ishgardian schoolâ”€the former placing a focus on tapping celestial aether and transforming it into beneficial magicks, or astromancy, the latter specializing solely in determining the actions of our dragon enemies to the north.

TEXT_JOBAST300_02012_JANNEQUINARD_000_006 -- I am a student of the formerâ”€the <Emphasis>only</Emphasis> student of the former here in Ishgardâ”€and have been actively seeking a partner with whom to conduct my research. Let us just say that my fellow astrologians here have been less than approving of my path. But that is simply because they are afraid of what they do not know. Once they <Emphasis>do</Emphasis> know of how Sharlayan astrology can benefit the See and its soldiers, they will feel foolish for ever having doubted me...ah, us!

TEXT_JOBAST300_02012_JANNEQUINARD_000_012 -- Alas, even a lifetime of study and training cannot unlock <Emphasis>all</Emphasis> the secrets written in those stars. Myself, I have been a student of the astromantic arts for more summers than I can count, and I still oft misread the signs shown to me in the skies. Though, my readings are far more accurate now than they were when I attended the Athenaeum in Sharlayan. Not <Emphasis>the</Emphasis> Sharlayan, mind you. The colony that once thrived in the Dravanian hinterlands.

TEXT_JOBAST300_02012_JANNEQUINARD_000_017 -- But not this day. No, no. I would not have you transcribe musty old tomes, like I was once forced to do. No, the task I have for you is <Emphasis>much</Emphasis> more interesting. You see, I am expecting the arrival of a very important guestâ”€my old mentor from the Studium has agreed to make the journey from the Old World to Ishgard and speak with the Holy See regarding the implementation of Sharlayan astrological techniques in cityâ€“state defense.

TEXT_JOBAST300_02012_MUGUENIEL_000_020 -- Let me guess, the good Lord Jannequinard said he saw you in a vision and that the stars told him that you were to study Sharlayan astrology with him. Am I close? You must be the hundredth of his little pets to pester me this week alone.

TEXT_JOBAST300_02012_MUGUENIEL_000_021 -- I harbor no ill will toward ignorant unbelievers unlucky enough to find themselves caught up in talk of stars and fortunes, but you may tell that sorry excuse for an astrologianâ”€<Emphasis>for the umpteenth time</Emphasis>â”€that I have heard <Emphasis>naught</Emphasis> concerning his imaginary friends from faraway Sharlayan. (Just do not tell the viscount I called him a sorry excuse for an astrologian, all right?)

TEXT_JOBAST300_02012_MUGUENIEL_000_028 -- Let me guess, the good Lord Jannequinard said he saw you in a vision and that the stars told him that you were to study Sharlayan astrology with him. Am I close? You must be the hundredth of his little pets to pester me this week alone.

TEXT_JOBAST300_02012_MUGUENIEL_000_029 -- I harbor no ill will toward ignorant unbelievers unlucky enough to find themselves caught up in talk of stars and fortunes, but you may tell that sorry excuse for an astrologianâ”€<Emphasis>for the umpteenth time</Emphasis>â”€that I have heard <Emphasis>naught</Emphasis> concerning his imaginary friends from faraway Sharlayan. (Just do not tell the viscount I called him a sorry excuse for an astrologian, all right?)

TEXT_JOBAST300_02012_FLEURAIE_000_020 -- Jannequinard is still waiting for word on his missing Sharlayans instead of actually making an effort to find them, is he? Of course he is. Is it any wonder that in the nearly fifteen years since his return from Sharlayan, his skill in astromancy has remained unchanged? Any wonder that he has never yet managed to convince a single peer of the value of the Sharlayan school? He is a privileged little sprat who spends more time gazing at the stars in young maidens' eyes than actually trying to read the ones above his head.

TEXT_JOBAST300_02012_FLEURAIE_000_021 -- <sigh> All right, all right. You tell the poor man I just returned from the Observatorium, and one night at the communal feasting hall, happened to overhear Chief Astrologian Forlemort speaking with one of his aides regarding Sharlayan. He was visibly upset, and I wasn't about to risk my career over something I care little about, so I merely put my head down and ate my beet soup. But that is all I know, and you did not hear it from me.

But that is all I know, and you did not hear it from me.

TEXT_JOBAST300_02012_JANNEQUINARD_000_045 -- Mine uncle, the Sharlayans have been wielding astromancy for ages without disrupting aetherial balance. This power, combined with Ishgardian astrology, could be what is needed to turn the tide of this thousand-year conflict. Moreover, I have reason to believe that our masters at the Vault agree, as they have given me their blessing to continue my research.

TEXT_JOBAST300_02012_JANNEQUINARD_000_046 -- <sigh> I did not come to trade barbs with you, Nuncle. Let us save that for another time. I am here because it has come to my attention that you may have information as to the whereabouts of Professor Mace and his party from Sharlayan.

TEXT_JOBAST300_02012_QUIMPERAIN_000_090 -- These are the Sharlayans we seek, and it appears they have found themselves some trouble.

TEXT_JOBAST301_02013_SEQ_01 -- After providing you with a brief but detailed introduction to astrology and astromancy, Leveva allows you a few moments to test out your newly acquired skills. Once you feel comfortable in your new skin, speak with the young Sharlayan astrologian and begin your search for her grandfather.

TEXT_JOBAST301_02013_LEVEVA_000_063 -- My grandfather is the greatest astrologian in all Sharlayan. There is naught he doesn't know unless he doesn't wish to know it. You of all people should know that.

TEXT_JOBAST301_02013_MACE_000_071 -- But do not despair. I have not given up on you completely. Despite your failings, you have tried your best to promote the Sharlayan school of astrology here in this den of fools who fail to see aught and all beyond the dragon star. I wish to see you continue that fight. And that is why I've bade Leveva to remain here and further your...and this adventurer's training.

TEXT_JOBAST301_02013_LEVEVA_000_074 -- I shall give you both several turns of the sun to study the basics of Sharlayan astrology. It should not be so hard for you, Jannequinard, considering you've had a substantial head start. Once you have committed the basics to memory, then return here. In the meantime, I will be traveling Eorzea, searching for locations where <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>...and you will unlock the remaining heavens' gates.

TEXT_JOBAST301_02013_JANNEQUINARD_000_077 -- I will...? I mean, I will. Yes, of course Lady Leveva. Anything for the granddaughter of Sharlayan's finest professor of astrology. Quimperain! You heard the lady.

TEXT_JOBAST350_02014_JANNEQUINARD_000_004 -- Astrologians of the Sharlayan school draw on the aether contained in the celestial bodies represented in the constellations by â€œunlockingâ€� or â€œopeningâ€� the gate to heaven that constellation is correlated with. There is no <Emphasis>actual</Emphasis> gate...think of it as more a portal to the soul. You are opening your mind, allowing for attunement with these distant bodies, much like one attunes with an aetheryte, but on a far grander scale.

TEXT_JOBAST350_02014_JANNEQUINARD_000_009 -- Oh, I harbor no ill feelings toward you regarding Professor Mace's decision to choose you over me as his successor. To tell you the truth, I was even sort of relieved. The successor to the greatest astrologian in Sharlayan? Think of all the responsibility...

TEXT_JOBAST350_02014_LEVEVA_000_046 -- Why do you think that it took so long for Professor Mace to visit you, Jannequinard? Yes, I know what he <Emphasis>told</Emphasis> you, but that was not the whole of it. Those of the Ruling Quarter did their damndest to stand in the way of my grandfather, worried that his passion for his field would kindle widespread interest in Sharlayan astrology. They only allowed him his recent trip, knowing he was now too old to do aught of the sort. Fortunately, the Ruling Quarter did not realize I would be accompanying my grandfather.

TEXT_JOBAST400_02015_SEQ_01 -- Leveva and Quimperain were ambushed once again by bandits, and the Sharlayan astrologian is currently recovering in a refurbished alcove on the second floor of the Athenaeum.

TEXT_JOBAST401_02016_SEQ_05 -- Quimperain claims that Leveva is scheduled to return to the Seventh Sage later this evening. Wait at the rendezvous point until the twelfth bell, and if the Sharlayan does not show, then proceed to the Drowning Wench to conduct one final search.

TEXT_JOBAST401_02016_SEQ_07 -- You return to find Jannequinard has already been scolded by Leveva for his absence on your most recent trip. He does, however, claim he spent the time productivelyâ”€speaking with high-ranking members of the Holy See about the possibility of holding an official audience with Leveva regarding Sharlayan astrology. His labors, unsurprisingly, bore no fruit.

â€»The next astrologian quest will be available from Jannequinard upon reaching level 45.

TEXT_JOBAST401_02016_REYNER_000_021 -- Yes, I took a few moments from my duties to speak with her about the cityâ€“state. She seemed quite interested in our dealings with the Sahagin, the Serpent Reavers, and the Garlean Empire. I told her what I could, but she left after only a few moments. It was as if she thought she was being pursued, but the Sharlayan was gone before I could assign her a Yellowjacket escort.

TEXT_JOBAST401_02016_JANNEQUINARD_000_122 -- And furthermore, it is not as if I was merely sipping cordials and waltzing with baronetsâ”€I was helping further our cause! I spoke with several high-ranking cardinals about Lady Leveva being granted the opportunity to speak at the Vault regarding Sharlayan astrology! What do you think of that!?

TEXT_JOBAST450_02017_JANNEQUINARD_000_001 -- Training? Pah! There'll be time enough for training later. No, I speak of our ultimate goal of spreading knowledge of the Sharlayan school of astrology throughout the Holy See! As you know, the Vault recently turned down my request to allow Lady Leveva to speak before them. But I am not one to be turned away so easily. No, I have a plan! I will entreat Chief Astrologian Forlemort to draw up an official recommendation! The Vault will not so quickly dismiss the words of a man of such standing.

TEXT_JOBAST450_02017_FORLEMORT_000_023 -- Sharlayan astrology has no place in Ishgard. It has no place in Eorzea. It has no place in this world. It is dangerous and it serves no purpose but to take our eyes off what is truly importantâ”€using astrology to free us from the dragon menace and ensure man's return to Halone's Kingdom. Leveva's dithering will only make it that much clearer.

TEXT_JOBAST450_02017_FORLEMORT_000_024 -- And Jannequinard. Perhaps this will finally spell his downfall. He has only been allowed to continue this nonsense because he is harmless. Too caught up in the luxury of being in line to Count de Durendaire's title to actually put forth any real effort in furthering his, ahem, â€œcause.â€� Sharlayan astrology is but an oddity which he can boast about at balls to get him in bed with the slatternly maids of lower houses. His father has protected him thus far, but allowing him and this lady to speak...there will be no brushing under the rug the shame this brings forth. Jannequinard will be finished.

TEXT_JOBAST450_02017_LEVEVA_000_054 -- I believe it is now quite obvious that these bandits were not meant for you, but for me. It would seem that certain parties fear the spread of Sharlayan astrology...and will stop at naught to prevent it.

TEXT_JOBAST450_02017_FEMAIL02017_000_055 -- My Sharlayan constellation chart... The bandits... It must have been torn when they seized me...

TEXT_JOBAST450_02017_QUIMPERAIN_000_058 -- Lady Leveva, you mentioned something about certain parties wanting to prevent the spread of Sharlayan astrology. Have you any idea who they might be?

TEXT_JOBAST501_02019_SEQ_03 -- When Leveva is accused of attacking the astrologian that the three of you recently rescued in Rathefrost, she freely surrenders herself to the Temple Knights for questioning. However, it is soon discovered that the knights are actually impostors tasked with delivering Leveva to a waiting Sharlayan thaumaturge who means to escort her back to the Old World. Wasting no time, you, Quimperain, andâ”€amazinglyâ”€Jannequinard join forces to defeat Leveva's abductors, and subsequently find a missive on the body of the Sharlayan mage. Speak with Leveva to discuss your next course of action.

TEXT_JOBAST501_02019_SEQ_06 -- Forlemort agrees that in exchange for your silence regarding the missive, he will no longer interfere in Leveva and Jannequinard's efforts at spreading the word of Sharlayan astrology in Ishgard. For now, you are free to take your first steps as a fully attuned astrologian.

TEXT_JOBAST501_02019_QIB_001_TODO_3 -- Slay the Sharlayan assailants.

TEXT_JOBAST501_02019_QIB_LEVEVA_BATTLETALK_01 -- I'm not going back to Sharlayan. Quimperain!

TEXT_JOBAST501_02019_JANNEQUINARD_000_059 -- Bandits disguised as astrologians disguised as Temple Knights working for evil Sharlayans... I hope the rest of you know what is going on because I am utterly bewildered.

TEXT_JOBAST501_02019_JANNEQUINARD_000_093 -- A letter carried by a party of less-than-savory characters who attempted to kidnap Lady Leveva and deliver her to Sharlayans, not to mention kill me, my manservant, and my good friend <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> hereâ”€who you may have forgotten is currently an honored guest of House Fortemps.

TEXT_JOBAST501_02019_JANNEQUINARD_000_096 -- In fact, we wish very little from you. Naught, you might sayâ”€in the sense that you are to never again use your influence to hamper our efforts at spreading Sharlayan astrology here in Ishgard. Involve yourself no more in the affairs of me or my guests, and your secret remains safe. I will even forgive you for trying to have me murdered. If, that is, you give me your word.

TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_SEQ_02 -- From the chief astrologian and his personal assistant you learn that a band of tattooed Sharlayans are the true masterminds behind the conspiracy to kidnap Leveva. Take this information back to Jannequinard at the Athenaeum.

TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_SEQ_06 -- You find Lady Leveva and learn of how she foiled another kidnapping attempt. After telling her of your findings, she lets down her guard a moment to talk about her father, who was also an astrologian, and how he died while trying to spread Sharlayan astrology in Ishgard. Jannequinard and Quimperain soon arrive bearing news of the Vault's acceptance of his petition to hold a symposium on astrology. Return to the Athenaeum to begin preparations.

TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_LEVEVA_000_003 -- As for myself, there are still some questions I need answered. The first being, how exactly did Forlemort come into contact with the Sharlayan assassins?

TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_FORLEMORT_000_010 -- Seven hells! I rue the day I ever see another Sharlayan. Please. I've done all you asked. What more do you want from me, blood!? Or are you simply here to boast?

TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_FORLEMORT_000_011 -- ...Or mayhap you wish to know how the Sharlayans came to be involved in my scheme? Hah! I thought as much. If it was so important, why didn't your Lady Leveva ask me earlier? Her head is so far in the stars, she fails to see what unfolds around her on the ground.

TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_FORLEMORT_000_012 -- The truth is, it was never my scheme in the first placeâ”€it was the Sharlayans'. They came to me not long after Professor Mace's ship was diverted to Thanalan. Yes, I said diverted. The pirates in the Strait of Merlthor, the magically manipulated storms off the Rhotano? All were staged to prevent your friends from ever arriving. But when they did, the Sharlayans were forced to change their plans. They required help hiring local hands discreetlyâ”€something they could not do as foreigners. I agreed to lend them my aid because I felt we both stood to benefit from the disappearance of Jannequinard and that foul chit.

TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_FORLEMORT_000_029 -- I was a fool not to realize that the moment the Sharlayans were discovered, they would be quick to betray my name. That missive was to be destroyed at the first sign of trouble...

TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_JANNEQUINARD_000_030 -- The Sharlayans came to him? That can only mean, then, that mine uncle was only a pawn in a much larger game...

TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_QUIMPERAIN_000_041 -- Lord Forlemort was not the one to hire the Sharlayans!? Lady Leveva will want to knowâ”€ Lady Leveva? Lady Leveva! She was right here!

TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_LEVEVA_000_061 -- So Forlemort wasn't the architect of this scheme to drag me back to Sharlayan after all. I had my suspicions... I was a fool to believe <Emphasis>they</Emphasis> would simply let me leave.

TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_LEVEVA_000_065 -- My father dreamed of rekindling the Holy See's interest in Sharlayan astrology, believing that it would be of great benefit to the embattled people of Ishgard. He came here several moons after I was born, intending to remain for only a season. However, he never made the return journey... His dream was left unrealized and his newborn daughter left without a father...

TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_JANNEQUINARD_000_070 -- They accepted it! We have been given official permission by the Holy See to conduct a symposium on the wonders of Sharlayan astrology, with you as our guest speaker! Now come! We must hurry back to the Athenaeum and begin preparations! <sigh> More than fifteen summers to make ready for this moment, and now I only have a matter of days!

TEXT_JOBAST502_02020_JANNEQUINARD_000_082 -- For a long time, I tried to prove that I could be as great as my cousin. It is why I went to Sharlayan. It is why I have tried to do things I had no business even trying. Then, once I realized no one was looking, I simply stopped caring, my actions becoming more and more outlandish...because at the end of the day, that is what everyone expected.

TEXT_JOBAST520_02021_SEQ_01 -- Jannequinard and Leveva's symposium on Sharlayan astrology is to be held in Falcon's Nestâ”€a small fortified hamlet in the Coerthas western highlands. Travel to the remote location beyond Snowcloak and find Jannequinard.

TEXT_JOBAST520_02021_SEQ_10 -- You speak with Jannequinard at the Athenaeum about Leveva's father. He, in turn, tells you about the murdered astrologian of whom the elder resident of Falcon's Nest spoke, and how that man was Jannequinard's friend and one of the reasons he still fights to spread Sharlayan astrology throughout Ishgard.

â€»The next astrologian quest will be available from Jannequinard upon reaching level 54.

TEXT_JOBAST520_02021_JANNEQUINARD_000_000 -- I have good news and bad news... The good news is, preparations for the symposium on Sharlayan astrology have been progressing smoothly, as we have expectedly encountered very little resistance from the Vault. They have even gone to the trouble of securing us a spacious venue for the event.

TEXT_JOBAST520_02021_QUIMPERAIN_000_010 -- Falcon's Nest is populated with knights and masons. Unless Sharlayan astrology can warm frostbitten toes or fill an empty belly, I do not believe we shall find many people who will even give us a quarter bell of their time.

TEXT_JOBAST520_02021_ROUJIN02021_000_020 -- Sharlayan astrology, eh? You a heretic? Because you're talkin' like one. There's only one kind of astrology in Ishgard, and it ain't the heathen kind.

TEXT_JOBAST520_02021_JANNEQUINARD_000_092 -- You see. The astrologian of whom the old man spokeâ”€it so happens that I knew him well. His name was Rufin, and he was my friend and confidant when I studied in Sharlayanâ”€my only friend. He followed me back to Ishgard when my stay in the cityâ€“state was cut short by the exodus.

TEXT_JOBAST540_02022_SEQ_04 -- Leveva is stabbed by a Sharlayan disguised as a wounded Convictor. However, she is no ordinary Sharlayan. A well-timed piece of exposition reveals her to be the same tattooed Sharlayan who has been attempting to kidnap Leveva since she arrived in the Black Shroud. She claims that she has been hired to bring Leveva back to the Old World, but you successfully drive her off before she can act. Join Jannequinard and cast Aspected Benefic on Leveva before her wound takes her.

TEXT_JOBAST540_02022_CELIE_000_033 -- (-Sharlayan Assassin-)Ah, the loyal lapdog. Without you to state the obvious, where would your masters be, pray tell?

TEXT_JOBAST540_02022_CELIE_000_035 -- (-Sharlayan Assassin-)One might think these markings would betray my identity, but you Eorzeans have a singular capacity to look without seeing. I am amazed you are not constantly wandering into bonfires or off cliffs.

TEXT_JOBAST540_02022_CELIE_000_036 -- (-Celie-)I have grown weary of this masquerade, and I am done with entrusting my fate to this realm's blundering mercenaries. My name is Celie, and I am here to take the Lady Leveva into custody so that she can be transported back to Sharlayan and tried for her crimes. 

TEXT_JOBAST540_02022_LEVEVA_000_050 -- Thank you, my friends... For someone who claims she was hired to bring me back to Sharlayan, her aim was quite true...

TEXT_JOBAST540_02022_LEVEVA_000_052 -- My grandfather knew the Forum would never allow us to come to Ishgard, and that their â€œcontemplationâ€� over the matter was merely a tactic to stall and discourage us. The stars had spoken to my grandfather, and he was not about to turn a deaf ear to them. I kept silent because I did not wish to let the petty politicking of men thousands of malms to the north stand in the way of our dreamâ”€our dream to spread the word of Sharlayan astrology.

TEXT_JOBAST540_02022_JANNEQUINARD_000_056 -- Your father and I became close friends when I was in Sharlayan. When the exodus forced me to return home, he asked if he could accompany me, saying that he wished to try and convince those who once believed in the stars' power to look to the skies again. And we did for several moons. My countrymen were deeply skeptical, and slow to warm to the idea of heathen magicksâ”€some were even rudeâ”€but he never gave up on them. Right up until he was...

TEXT_JOBAST560_02023_SEQ_05 -- Just as you arrive, the Sharlayan mercenary Celie appears from the trees. A battle ensues, though it is Celie who has the decided advantage, this time bringing a veritable army to fight at her side. The tide turns, however, when from the hamlet arrive four of the hunters you healed earlier, bows in hand. It is not long before Celie is slain and a great burden is lifted from your party's shoulders. Return to the Athenaeum Astrologicum with Jannequinard.

TEXT_JOBAST560_02023_SEQ_06 -- Jannequinard seems worried about the possibility that the Sharlayan Forum will come for Leveva. Fortunately for you, this worry reminds him of a technique he learned while studying abroad, and he is kind enough to pass it on to you.

â€»The next astrologian quest will be available from Jannequinard upon reaching level 58.

TEXT_JOBAST560_02023_JANNEQUINARD_000_000 -- I am happy to report that Leveva is fine and well, and hasn't been attacked by bandits, dastards, curs, Sharlayan spies, or disgruntled knights once since her last encounter at the Convictory.

TEXT_JOBAST560_02023_LEVEVA_000_011 -- I would like to believe this proof that word of the benefits of Sharlayan astrology is slowly but surely spreading through the realm. Ah, but enough talk. There are still many ailing souls that require succor. Would you and Jannequinard mind assisting me again as you did in the western highlands?

TEXT_JOBAST560_02023_JANNEQUINARD_000_044 -- Quimperain, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. Would you be so kind as to accompany the lady on her stroll? It has been far too long since that Sharlayan assassin showed her face, and a reading I conducted earlier this morning showed a day rife with conflict and confusion.

TEXT_JOBAST560_02023_CELIE_000_054 -- (-Celie-)Such passion... It is a pity it remains misdirected. My employer only wishes to see you back, safe in Sharlayan. The Forum recognizes your talent. You are an asset to our nation and its people. We would have you live a long and prosperous life, so that you may rise even higher than your father ever had the opportunity to.

TEXT_JOBAST560_02023_JANNEQUINARD_000_064 -- Leveva! I daresay those men would not have risked their lives had they little respect for us or our craft. You were right. Our actions here have done more to promote Sharlayan astrology than any long-winded discourse. Why, I expect this very night, the tale of your daring deeds will be told a hundred times over in mead halls across the forelands.

TEXT_JOBAST560_02023_LEVEVA_000_065 -- Which means it will not be long before the Forum has heard as well. We Sharlayans may have officially abandoned this realm, but our ears remain. If the one who hired Celie is who I think it is, then I expect naught less than a formal edict of extradition to be issued.

TEXT_JOBAST560_02023_JANNEQUINARD_000_066 -- An edict of extradition? But Sharlayan has no power to force Ishgard to deliver you into their hands.

TEXT_JOBAST560_02023_LEVEVA_000_068 -- Things changed after you left, Jannequinard. Many even believe it was my father's death that tipped the scales in favor of closing Sharlayan's doors and locking away all our knowledge. If the Forum deems it so, I could be arrested and imprisoned for â€œthe theft of national resources.â€� And I see no reason why your Holy See, who has already shown its disdain for our efforts, would stand in its way.

TEXT_JOBAST560_02023_JANNEQUINARD_000_082 -- If only we had more time! When I was studying in Sharlayan, I heard whispers of an ancient astromantic spell which could stop time and the very movements of the heavens. All of my professors denied it existed, of course...

TEXT_JOBAST580_02024_SEQ_06 -- You rescue Leveva and Jannequinard from several hungry creatures, only to have your warm reunion cut short by the arrival of Sevestreâ”€the high-ranking Sharlayan official who hired Celie to capture Leveva. Sevestre has detained Leveva's ailing grandfather and tells her that if she wishes him released, she must return with him to the Old World.

TEXT_JOBAST580_02024_SEQ_09 -- Leveva has decided to surrender herself to Sevestre and quietly return with the man to Sharlayan so that no harm may come to her grandfather and mother. Jannequinard has agreed to escort her to the abandoned Sharlayan cityâ€“state in the Dravanian hinterlands, despite the fact his life may also be in danger.

â€»The next astrologian quest will be available from Jannequinard upon reaching level 60.

TEXT_JOBAST580_02024_SEVESTRE_000_052 -- Clever girl. Yes, it was I who hired Celie to bring you back to Sharlayan. And if you had come back with us quietly, you would be free right now, rather than a wanted criminal facing a trial, imprisonment, even execution...depending on what you have told these tamed savages of yours. Yes, my dear. I offered you a chance, and you foolishly refused it. The edict has been issued. And I am here to collect you.

TEXT_JOBAST580_02024_LEVEVA_000_071 -- Sevestreâ”€leader of the Bibliothecsâ”€a powerful group of conservative fundamentalists who seek to control the whole of Sharlayan's knowledge. They believe that our people should not become involved in history, only be witness to it. Then analyze it until all the lives lived and lost are but numbers on a page.

TEXT_JOBAST580_02024_LEVEVA_000_072 -- You may remember Sevestre, Jannequinard, because he is the selfsame man who has pushed for old Sharlayan to batten its doors...and has used my father's death as his rallying cry.

TEXT_JOBAST580_02024_LEVEVA_000_074 -- Near the end of my father's diary, he mentions being contacted by a young Sevestre, who happened to be an older classmate of his when they were both at the Studium. Sevestre, looking to make a name for himself as a politician, warned my father against continuing to disseminate knowledge of Sharlayan astrology in Eorzea. A warning my father, of course, did not heed.

TEXT_JOBAST580_02024_CAPTAIN02024_000_080 -- Many lives were saved because of you. If this is what we can expect from Sharlayan astrology, I see no reason why we shouldn't have knights trained in the field. I will recommend this to the lord commander. I suspect he will be pleased to see the day won with so few casualties.

TEXT_JOBAST580_02024_JANNEQUINARD_000_090 -- Moments ago, we received a missive from the commander of my father's guard. He thanked us again for our assistance in Hemlock, and has formally requested that Lady Leveva train several of his knights in Sharlayan astrology.

TEXT_JOBAST600_02025_SEQ_01 -- As a last-ditch effort to save Lady Leveva and her grandfather, you conceive a plan in which you will attempt to fool Sevestre into believing you possess a second document that could implicate him in Rufin's murder. Travel to Sharlayan's Answering Quarter in the Dravanian hinterlands and rendezvous with Jannequinard to begin your preparations for the final showdown.

TEXT_JOBAST600_02025_SEQ_03 -- The time is nigh for your confrontation with Sevestre. Proceed to the place of meeting and wait for the Sharlayan official's arrival.

TEXT_JOBAST600_02025_TODO_00 -- Speak with Jannequinard in Sharlayan's Answering Quarter.

TEXT_JOBAST600_02025_LEVEVA_000_009 -- This is where my people lived... Where my father was born and raised. Where he became an astrologian. Where he took his first steps on the path that would lead us all here. He was not a Sharlayan. Not even Hyuran. He was an Eorzean. Like Jannequinard and Quimperain. Even you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>.

TEXT_JOBAST600_02025_JANNEQUINARD_000_029 -- Not all of the conversations Rufin and I had here were pleasant. He was a fiery spirit, who, once an idea had filled his head, would make it his whole life, regardless of how outlandish it was. Reintroducing Sharlayan astrology to Eorzea was one such idea. I was against it at first, knowing firsthand how traditionalist the people of my cityâ€“state were... But your father overwhelmed me with his passion, and it was not long before I, too, found myself a disciple of his vision.

TEXT_JOBAST600_02025_LEVEVA_000_072 -- You will then send word back to the Old World to have my grandfather released immediately. And finally, you will return to Sharlayan and report to the Forum that I have disappeared and am presumed deceased. Fail to do these things, and I shall tell the Forum all I know of your involvement in my father's death. I doubt they will be as generous with their mercy as I.

TEXT_JOBAST600_02025_LEVEVA_100_093 -- (-Rufin-)<Emphasis>Contrary to popular opinion</Emphasis>, I was not murdered at all, but merely on a long and winding journey that has finally brought me back to Ishgard so that I may teach the secrets of Sharlayan astrology once again.

TEXT_JOBAST601_02409_SEQ_01 -- Leveva, daughter of disgraced (and deceased) astrologian Rufin, granddaughter of eccentric (yet powerful) Mace, came to Ishgard from faraway Sharlayan to preach the virtues of her homeland's school of astrology. However, forces in both the Holy See and the island nation of scholars to the north would work to prevent her from accomplishing that very thing. Yet, with your aid and (to a far lesser extent) that of the nobleman Jannequinard de Durendaire, Leveva is able to thwart her enemies and open the door for bringing Ishgard into an all new era of astrological studies.

A quick chat with Jannequinard reveals that Lady Leveva, now going by the name of her father, is currently awaiting your arrival at the First Dicasterial Observatorium of Aetherial and Astrological Phenomena.

TEXT_JOBAST601_02409_SEQ_02 -- Was it chance? Was it fate? Does it matter? When visiting your old mentor, Leveva, the Observatorium receives a most unexpected visitor in Kyokuho, a traveler from the Far East. Kyokuho expresses his interest in learning the art of Sharlayan astrology, to which Leveva begrudgingly agrees to helpâ”€or rather, agrees to let <Emphasis>you</Emphasis> help by accompanying the man to Rootslake in the South Shroud where you will guide him in opening the gate to the first heaven.

TEXT_JOBAST601_02409_JANNEQUINARD_000_001 -- Well, since Ishgard's quite abrupt change in leadership, the Vault has become somewhat more receptive to the contemporary ideas of Lady Leveâ”€er, Master Rufin. They have even asked our compatriot-in-disguise to hold for them another symposium on Sharlayan astrology...and this time within the cityâ€“state proper, and not at some forsaken hamlet! (Nothing against the fine citizenry of Falcon's Nest, mind you.)

TEXT_JOBAST601_02409_KYOKUHO_000_069 -- I was just speaking with these fine ladies regarding their thoughts on the Sharlayan school of astrology. Your name came up quite often. Everyone here seems to think very highly of you. Of Jannequinard? Er...

TEXT_JOBAST650_02411_JANNEQUINARD_000_030 -- The reading did only mention â€œfriends oldâ€� and â€œfriends new.â€� I recall nothing in there about silver-haired astrologians from Sharlayan. But how do you propose <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/> find our charge? The Far East is a big place. Perhaps we could write a letter?

TEXT_JOBAST700_02413_LEVEVA_000_035 -- The symposium was a rousing success, the Vault quick to realize the benefits my school's wisdom could bring when applied to the rebuilding of Ishgard. It was even decided that several new courses in Sharlayan astrology were to be taught at the scholasticate starting next term.

TEXT_JOBDEFAST_00294_GUILLESTET_000_012 -- The rest of the time, he continues his â€œstudiesâ€� of Sharlayan astrologyâ”€something he began almost twenty summers ago when he spent time in the now abandoned cityâ€“state training with the heathen astrologians. His bloodline protects him from the scrutiny of higher-ranking officials here, but it is his lack of talent which truly keeps the wolves at bay.

TEXT_JOBDEFAST_00294_GUILLESTET_000_022 -- Ah... We also offer...limited training in Sharlayan astrologyâ”€a school of star reading neither recognized nor approved of by the Athenaeum, the Observatorium, or the Holy See.

TEXT_JOBDEFAST_00294_GUILLESTET_000_030 -- Astrology originated thousands of years ago in Sharlayan, and was introduced to Eorzea when the Sharlayans founded their colony in the Dravanian hinterlands.

TEXT_JOBDEFAST_00294_GUILLESTET_000_003 -- I...ah, may have been hasty in my judgment of Sharlayan astrology, as it appears more than simple fortune-telling.

TEXT_JOBDEFAST_00294_GUILLESTET_000_004 -- Do you know how long it took me to accept Sharlayan astrology as a legitimate school of knowledge? And now you are asking me to accept the teachings of this Far Eastern flake? I should have been a machinist...

TEXT_JOBDEFAST_00294_GUILLESTET_000_050 -- Lord Forlemortâ”€chief astrologian at the Observatorium, and longtime vocal dissident of Lord Jannequinard's dabbling in Sharlayan astrologyâ”€has mysteriously fallen silent, at least with his objections to the young noble's eccentricities.

TEXT_JOBDEFAST_00294_GUILLESTET_000_052 -- Lady Leveva seems a smart woman, yet I do not see why she insists on remaining in a place that so obviously wishes her immediate departure. I would have returned to Sharlayan long ago if I were in her same shoes.

TEXT_JOBDEFAST_00294_GUILLESTET_000_100 -- In between her training of the House Durendaire knights, Lady Levâ”€ah, Lord Rufin has been traveling the countryside, visiting camps and outposts, doling out succor to those in needâ”€spreading the word of Sharlayan astrology without actually saying a word.

TEXT_JOBDEFAST_00294_GUILLESTET_000_102 -- But there are times I catch him practicing a spell or two when he believes no one is watching. Perhaps I was wrong to judge him...as perhaps I was wrong to judge Sharlayan astrology.

TEXT_JOBDEFAST_00294_GUILLESTET_000_130 -- Master Rufin has been positively obsessed with your activities of late. She believes that your work in her homeland bodes well for the proliferation of Sharlayan astrology...

TEXT_JOBDEFAST_00294_GUILLESTET_000_062 -- Ah... We also offer limited training in Sharlayan astrologyâ”€a school of star reading not formally recognized by the Athenaeum, the Observatorium, or the Holy See...but no longer fully opposed by them either. The only reason I even mention it is because Lord Jannequinard quietly insists.

TEXT_JOBDEFAST_00294_GUILLESTET_000_110 -- Lady Levâ”€excuse me, Lord Rufin's activity around the realm has resulted in increased awareness of Sharlayan astrology, making it more accepted amongst the public. Interest in the field has become so great that the Holy See can no longer simply brush it under the brume, so they instead allow it, if only so they can keep a close eye on it.

TEXT_JOBDEFAST_00294_GUILLESTET_000_113 -- We also offer training in Sharlayan astrologyâ”€a school of star reading not formally recognized by the Athenaeum, the Observatorium, or the Holy See...but no longer fully opposed by them either. Training is overseen by both Lord Jannequinard and Lord Rufin...but mostly Lord Rufin.

TEXT_JOBDEFGFF2_00730_LALAHJINJAHL_000_020 -- All is well thanks to you and your invaluable aid. Guildivain has been sent back to Sharlayan, where he will be tried by the Forum, and I've no doubt but that he will get his just deserts.

TEXT_JOBDEFSMN_00097_YMHITRA_000_010 -- My name is Y'mhitra. I am affiliated with the Sons of Saint Coinach, a research organization comprised of Sharlayan scholars and Eorzean sages.

TEXT_JOBRDM501_02577_XRHUNTIA_000_241 -- Even after leaving Ala Mhigo, I never ceased fighting for its liberation. And when I learned of the Calamityâ”€of the threat to all the lands of Eorzeaâ”€I allied myself with the valiant scholars of Sharlayan.

TEXT_JOBRDM630_02584_XRHUNTIA_000_321 -- I think we'll have our suffering friend delve into the scrolls for us. The Sharlayans have left behind a veritable mountain of lore through which we can dig for answers.

TEXT_JOBRDM650_02585_XRHUNTIA_000_092 -- And you say the book was seen in the Great Gubal Library? I've not entered that place since the Sharlayans departed this land. What of you, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>?

TEXT_JOBREL007_00206_GEROLT_000_081 -- Ye know them Archons from Sharlayan? They use newfangled goggles what allow the wearer to see traces of aether. We can make somethin' similar, I reckon.

TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_SEQ_01 -- You happen upon Rowena just as two unexpected visitors arrive. The first is an earnest young researcher bearing an urgent request, the second, Gerolt the ale-sodden blacksmith. Wasting no time, the researcher, one Ardashir, declares that he has been conducting research into the creation of artificial lifeâ”€something he refers to as â€œanima.â€� Though all of his trials have thus far ended in failure, he is convinced that the Sharlayans' work on arcane sentries holds the key to success. Before he can continue with his suit, however, Gerolt decries him for his lack of imagination, and wryly suggests fusing the anima with a weaponâ”€a proposal which Ardashir considers a stroke of genius. Never one to miss a chance to turn a profit, Rowena sets about persuading Gerolt to take part in the venture, and before you know it, you too have been roped in to test the finished product. You are to rendezvous with Ardashir and Gerolt in Azys Lla, where the pair will apparently be working.

TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_ARDASHIR_000_016 -- I am certain that with the Sharlayans' knowledge of arcane sentries, I can complete my project. I am also certain that the resultant souls will be worth more to mankind than the ale-soaked dishclout that passes for yours!

TEXT_JOBREL100_02211_GEROLT_000_019 -- D'ye reckon them scholarly folks from Sharlayan asked for the answer whenever they got stuck? Not bloody likely! 'Cause they used their bloody brains!

TEXT_JOBREL103_02214_GEROLT_000_005 -- Ah, ye had me fooled when you was beggin' and pleadin' to see those Sharlayan books before. Good to know yer incompetence was only fer show. Well, seein' as ye have everythin' under control, if ye don't mind I think I'llâ”€

TEXT_JOBREL300_02328_ARDASHIR_000_006 -- Indeed I have, though it will require a trip to Idyllshire. My quest to find Sharlayan researchers there bore no fruit, but I did meet with a young lady whose field of expertise is quite similar to mine own.

TEXT_JOBREL300_02328_ARDASHIR_000_008 -- When last we spoke, she sought an apprenticeship from the selfsame Sharlayan researchers who refused me an audience. No doubt they have left her waiting in Idyllshire even now.

TEXT_JOBREL300_02328_ULAN_000_023 -- I see. Before you left Idyllshire you spoke of your preliminary proposal for the Sharlayans. I would very much like to hear how your work has progressed thus far.

TEXT_JOBREL521_02404_SEQ_06 -- Ardashir would proceed with the next stage of Matoya's plan: namely, to employ an enchantment to ingrain the anima's newly gained knowledge into the core of its being. There is, however, a rubâ”€all the materials needed for the procedure are readily available save oneâ”€an ancient variety of enchanted ink said to be made only in the lands of Sharlayan. Knowing of no merchants who might deal in such exotic goods, Ardashir defers to your unequaled talent for procurement.

TEXT_JOBREL521_02404_ARDASHIR_000_026 -- There are those, however, who insist it is still being manufactured to the present day...in secret, deep in the heart of the Sharlayan motherland. Would that I were acquainted with a merchant who trades in exotic goods! Or perhaps there is another way...?

TEXT_JOBSMN300_01091_YMHITRA_000_011 -- I am a member of the Sons of Saint Coinach. Ours is a Sharlayan order that seeks the lost knowledge of the Allagan Empire.

TEXT_LUCKBC013_03222_SEQ_06 -- As it turns out, Lady Leveva is struggling to formulate how the schools of Sharlayan astrology and Far Eastern geomancy might be incorporated into a single art. Recollections of your time spent in the First, however, have given her cause for excitement. She now asks for you to cast Aspected Benefic that she might witness firsthand your bond to this nightless realm's astral energies.

TEXT_LUCKBC013_03222_JANNEQUINARD_000_119 -- I see. It comes as little surprise that one of her social standing would be betrothed at such a young age. Such is the custom amongst older housesâ”€even in a city as progressive as Sharlayanâ”€and she hails from one of the oldest.

TEXT_LUCKBC013_03222_LEVEVA_000_143 -- Despite repeated efforts following our recent achievements in Kugane, I have been unable to conceive feasible means of blending the teachings of Sharlayan astrology and those of Far Eastern geomancy.

TEXT_LUCKMB110_03311_TODO_00 -- Use the Sharlayan box to capture a weakened hawker.

TEXT_LUCKMI104_03774_TATARU_000_031 -- Doesn't it just! It's called â€œArchon loaf,â€� in case you're wondering, and it's what they eat over in Sharlayan.

TEXT_LUCKMI104_03774_TATARU_000_032 -- It <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> bread, silly! And not just <Emphasis>any</Emphasis> old bread. This here is <Emphasis>Old World</Emphasis> bread. â€œArchon loaf,â€� to be precise. It's what they eat over in Sharlayan!

TEXT_LUCKMI104_03774_KRILE_000_058 -- Excuse me, Rammbroes. As a fellow Sharlayan, may I trouble you for your opinion?

TEXT_LUCKMI104_03774_RAMMBROES_000_065 -- In Sharlayan, the majority regard food as a source of nourishment rather than enjoyment. Save for those few who actually research the culinary arts, we pay little heed to the niceties of taste and texture.

TEXT_LUCKMI104_03774_MYSTERYVOICE_000_091 -- By the Twelve... Archon loaf! However did you come by this? I'd swear it had come straight from Sharlayan...

TEXT_LUCKMJ102_04008_ALISAIE_000_105 -- He asserted that Sharlayan's knowledge should <Emphasis>rightly</Emphasis> be used to protect all life on the starâ”€in direct opposition to the country's cherished policy of nonintervention. Being a leading member of the Forum, our father was...not happy.

TEXT_LUCKMK104_04061_GRAHATIA_000_183 -- Fascinating! This correlates with the writings of the Sharlayan scholar Rurusha.

TEXT_LUCKMK106_04063_SEQ_05 -- Scant moments after welcoming you home, Krile announces her intention to depart for Sharlayan to petition the Forum's aid in uncovering the Telophoroi's true motives; a proposal which raises eyebrows among her fellow Archons, but one to which they ultimately acquiesce. The surprises do not end there, however. Krile also reveals that the investigation she recently conducted alongside Y'shtola concerned the apparent lack of communication between Hydaelyn and Her chosen championâ”€you. This, she declares, is another question to which she hopes to find answers during her trip. Acknowledging that her departure will leave the Scions a member short, however, she turns at last to Estinien, and invites him once more to join the cause. And, perhaps most surprisingly of all, he accepts.

TEXT_LUCKML102_04065_ALPHINAUD_000_127 -- Sharlayan has sent an envoy, who is due to arrive in Gridania at any moment!

TEXT_LUCKML102_04065_ALPHINAUD_000_180 -- Ninety-nine may seem like rather a lot of members, but before the Forum was founded, every person of age in Sharlayan was given equal say in its governance.

TEXT_LUCKML102_04065_GRAHATIA_000_185 -- During my time in Sharlayan, I heard much of Fourchenault Leveilleur. He is a gifted speaker, known amongst other things for the uncompromising application of Forum policy.

TEXT_LUCKML102_04065_KANESENNA_000_211 -- Word of Master Fourchenault's visit took us quite by surprise. When the Alliance granted Mistress Krile permission to request Sharlayan's aid, we did not anticipate so prompt a reply, much less that it would be delivered by a member of the Forum.

TEXT_LUCKML102_04065_KANESENNA_000_240 -- It was not so very long ago that we had a friend and neighbor in Sharlayan, and so I clung to the hope that she might yet lend us her strength. But when she forsook Dravania, it would seem she forsook us all.

TEXT_LUCKML102_04065_A1_000_200 -- I've always wanted to visit Sharlayan!

TEXT_LUCKML102_04065_KRILE_000_285 -- (-Krile-)Excellent. Obviously, keeping the Telophoroi at bay must take precedence, but with luck, you'll be able to make the journey to Sharlayan ere long.

TEXT_LUCKML102_04065_KANESENNA_000_290 -- Your speculations give me cause to hope. Yet if these seeds will bear fruit, I cannot say. While it is possible the Sharlayans hide some secret truth from us, there can be no certainty that its exposure will prompt in them a change of heart. And so, for the present, we must needs confront the plight in which we find ourselves.

TEXT_LUCKML102_04065_ALPHINAUD_000_294 -- What does Sharlayan intend to do if we fail?

TEXT_LUCKML103_04066_SEQ_00 -- Kanâ€“Eâ€“Senna seems determined not to let the disappointment of Sharlayan's rejection distract her from the task at hand.

TEXT_LUCKML103_04066_SEQ_05 -- Reasoning that the Grand Company of Eorzea can be relied upon to keep the Telophoroi at bay, Lord Aymeric requests that the Scions search instead for a means to neutralize the threat of the towers. Given Sharlayan's preeminence in the field of aetherological research, it is agreed that the solution will most likely be found there; along, perhaps, with knowledge pertaining to the Final Days. Unfortunately, you will not be able to confirm your suspicions until Krile has obtained permission for you all to set foot in the infamously insular nation, and a long wait seems in prospect.

Sometime later, you accompany Y'shtola and the others on an expedition to investigate the mechanism by which the towers absorb aether, and learn to your dismay that they are draining the lifeblood of the land itself. As you grimly turn for home, you hear an ephemeral voice call out to you and you alone...

It warns that the end draws nigh...and that the fate of the star is in your hands.

â€»The next main scenario quest will be available from Alphinaud once you have met the following requirements:
â€» You must have registered a product key for FINAL FANTASY XIV: Endwalker to your service account.
â€» You must have completed the main scenario quest â€œDeath Unto Dawn.â€�

TEXT_LUCKML103_04066_ALPHINAUD_000_000 -- Throughout my childhood, I remember Grandfather arguing with my father over Sharlayan's policy of nonintervention. And this time, it was my turn to play the role.

TEXT_LUCKML103_04066_GRAHATIA_000_010 -- The Forum includes representatives from all of Sharlayan's central institutions. With them hindering Krile's investigation, she will struggle to make any headway on her own.

TEXT_LUCKML103_04066_KANESENNA_000_030 -- While Sharlayan's stance is indeed disappointing, we cannot allow ourselves to be distracted from the challenge before us. There is much and more to be done.

TEXT_LUCKML103_04066_GRAHATIA_100_765 -- ...Sharlayan.

TEXT_LUCKML103_04066_URIANGER_104_765 -- Nor can I think of a more promising place to look for the answers we seek on the matter of the towers. Sharlayan hath ever been the wellspring of aetherological knowledge.

TEXT_REGDRA2NOTORIOUSMONSTERHINTT1_00267_YLOISE_000_022 -- It was brought here as a youngling by a Sharlayan scholar, who raised it in a specially constructed glasshouse in some vain attempt to research its ecology.

TEXT_STMBDI201_03089_LINAMEWRILAH_000_010 -- In her message, Alma mentioned a guest from Sharlayan. Someone your companion Cid Garlond believed might be able to assist the Principal's research. An â€œarchetype,â€� I think is the term she used.

TEXT_STMBDI303_03189_00543_MIKOTO_500_060 -- <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>. It is almost sad to see our quest come to an end, though we have given the land's scholars much to consider. Sharlayan will have to open a school of Ivalician studies, are we to keep up.

TEXT_STMBDI303_03189_00543_MIKOTO_500_202 -- But witnessing you and all you achieved in our short time together has inspired me. When I return to Sharlayan, I will put in a request with the Students of Baldesion for an increase in field research!

You accompany them to their waiting airship, with Omega sharing the results of its investigations while you walk. Omega concludes that Sir's illogical actions strongly indicate the presence of a â€œheart,â€� which it has now defined as â€œa phenomenon which influences one's interpretation of reality.â€�

Upon arriving at the vessel, Biggs presses Omega to hold up its part of the bargain, and it finally provides you with a translation of the mystery transmission. It is a simple message, of hope and shared joy, the spiritual value of which appears lost on the ever-practical Omicron.

TEXT_STMBDR602_04587_SEQ_12 -- With the investigation over and its promised duty discharged, Omega returns to traveling the star with Alpha. Sharlayan, Radzâ€“atâ€“Han, Garlemaldâ”€the wide world and its many peoples await. There are questions yet to be answered, and the road ahead is long...

TEXT_STMBDY005_03142_SEQ_04 -- Following your successful expedition into the deepest recesses of the Arboretum, Midnight Dew and Edgyth were able to carry out a thorough investigation of the mysterious, vitality-bestowing mud. Research materials found within reveal the Sharlayans had created a concoction that acts as a catalyst in the decomposition of plant matter into nutrient-rich compost. Having discovered the secret of the ooze, Edgyth is confident that she can use these findings to revitalize the depleted soil around Idyllshire. Perhaps it will not be long before the locals enjoy the fruitsâ”€and vegetablesâ”€of your labor.

TEXT_STMBDY005_03142_EDGYTH_100_046 -- According to the Sharlayan reports... Well, I'll spare you the details of its botanical jargon. Let's just say the mud makes seedkin, in a word, angry.

TEXT_STMBDY005_03142_EDGYTH_000_048 -- Yes, I'm surprised the Sharlayans didn't keep it in a safer place. In any case, we can use their findings to breathe new life into the soil of Dravania. As for the seedkin, a little water washes the mud right off. Allow me to demonstrate!

TEXT_SUBCTS670_04523_AMELIANCE_000_017 -- Yes. As you know, Sharlayan has long closed its borders and avoided interfering in the affairs of other nations, bound by a single-minded focus to secure the safety of the peoples of this star.

TEXT_SUBCTS670_04523_ROWENA_000_034 -- (...Her husband's supposed to be a bigwig in that Forum o' theirs, ain't he? Stands to reason she may've heard rumblings of Sharlayan investing deeper in its education system. And in that case, it'd be wiser to invest now to reap the benefits later...)

TEXT_VOICEMAN_02300_B00360_URIANGER -- I will depart at once to convene with the sages of Sharlayan. Together shall we divine the steps by which our goals may be achieved.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_02500_800190_URIANGER -- When he left Sharlayan behind, Master Louisoix gave no word to signal his intent to Moenbryda. Close as they were, as master and disciple, she was deeply wounded by the sudden exclusion from his confidence.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03400_001280_ALISAIE -- I found myself asking what it was all for. Why try if I was doomed to fail in the end? But then I recalled Grandfather's words to my father, years ago, before he left Sharlayan behind forever.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_03400_001380_ALISAIE -- We had no clear memories of our life in the hinterlands, having returned to the motherland as infants. Nevertheless, I am quite familiar with Master Matoya, as is every Sharlayan. I should like to speak with her someday.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05500_002180_KRILE -- Oh, I well remember what they're like. The Forum's barefaced refusal to assist you in the days prior to the Calamity must rank as Sharlayan's most shameful act since the exodus.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05500_002230_KRILE -- If there are no objections, I shall depart for Sharlayan at once. But before I do, I should also mention the other matter to which I would devote some time during my stay.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05500_002360_KRILE -- Then again, who am I to say? The fact is, we simply don't know. But if the explanation is to be found anywhere, I can think of worse places to look than the archives of Sharlayanâ”€and their research on the aetherial sea in particular.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05500_002490_ALPHINAUD -- You will be sorely missed. Tread warily in Sharlayan...and do try not to let the Forum embroil you in their politics. A forlorn hope, I know, given the individuals involved...

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05505_003200_FOURCHENAULT -- The â€œFinal Daysâ€�? Pray, spare me your hyperbole. This conflict is no more than the latest in a series of petty squabbles between yourselves and Garlemald. One in which Sharlayan will take no part. If the Final Days were truly upon us, we would know.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05505_003240_ALISAIE -- If Eorzea falls, so too will Sharlayan. So if you truly love our homeland, you will join usâ”€now, before it's too late!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05505_003260_FOURCHENAULT -- I thought you knew better than to raise your voice to your elders. It seems I was wrong. Wrong to ever let you leave Sharlayan. I consoled myself that your time abroad would instill in you some hint of restraint, of discipline.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05505_003320_FOURCHENAULT -- By espousing such barbaric notions, you subvert the teachings of Sharlayan and place all we have worked for in jeopardy.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05505_003370_KANESENNA -- Master Fourchenault! While Sharlayan may have no intention of intervening in this conflict, we can still part as friends. Will you not stay and speak with us, that we might learn of Sharlayan's hopes for the morrow?

TEXT_VOICEMAN_05505_003690_ALPHINAUD -- My fellow Scions... As I am sure you will have heard, we can expect no help from Sharlayan, nor are we any closer to discerning the Telophoroi's grand design.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_000830_ESTINIEN -- Hasn't Sharlayan all but severed relations with foreign powers? Those of us without direct tiesâ”€myself includedâ”€may be refused outright...

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_000840_YSHTOLA -- 'Tis true that, as a nation, Sharlayan only forms trade agreements with a select few neutral countries.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_000890_YSHTOLA -- The immigration officer will ask for your affiliation and your purpose of visit. Considering Sharlayan's views on intervention, I strongly suggest we avoid any mention of the Scions.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_001090_GRAHATIA -- These last two are not Sharlayan natives, but you will find their credentials are in order. An application was made in advance...

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_001270_KRILE -- Welcome, friends, to Sharlayan!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_001340_KRILE -- The first involves an investigation into the change which has come over Sharlayan, not to mention the recent, inscrutable behavior of the Forum.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_001360_KRILE -- The Bibliothecs, for example, are a group of conservatives which would have Sharlayan focus on recording history, while remaining entirely uninvolved in the making of it.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_001440_KRILE -- Compared to our more isolationist Sharlayan colleagues, we have strong connections overseasâ”€namely with scholars and academics who share our passion for the unknown.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_001520_YSHTOLA -- But the investigation in Sharlayan is of vital importance as well. Equal, I think, to the Thavnairian one, given that the fate of the world may hinge on the results of both.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_001560_KRILE -- As for myself, I shall continue what I've begun in Sharlayan. I should also like to steal the services of an Archon or two.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_001700_ALISAIE -- Do you remember when the decision was made to come to Sharlayan?

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_001790_ALISAIE -- Sharlayan is famous for archiving knowledge from around the world. Well, that knowledge is not preserved exclusively in dusty tomes and desiccated samples.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_001910_KRILE -- But I assure you that we are beneath Sharlayan itself. The breeze you feel, the flowing waters you hearâ”€all created by the hand of man.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_002420_BOTANISTMAN -- Yet even with the collected wisdom of Sharlayan at our disposal, we've yet to identify the underlying principle of this empathic effect.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_002740_ERENVILLE -- We are not familiars to be exploited. We are Sharlayan scholars, and we deserve an explanation for this unseemly treatment. What warrants such urgency?

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_002750_REQUESTEDLEGISLATOR -- ...In an age long past, Sharlayan was charged with a momentous duty.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_003100_FOURCHENAULT -- Mistress Baldesion. Our records show you facilitated the Scions' entrance into Sharlayan by claiming them as assistants for your organization.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_003130_ALPHINAUD -- â€œClandestineâ€�? We may not have entered Sharlayan as Scions, but we did naught to conceal our identities.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_003320_FOURCHENAULT -- As you are all aware, we recently denied Eorzea's request for Sharlayan assistance.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_003400_YSHTOLA -- A terrible enemy stands poised to lay waste to all we hold dear. In the face of such madness, Eorzea reached out to Sharlayan, a respected ally, in the hopes of forming a united front.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_003480_GRAHATIA -- At first glance, the positions of neutrality in war and the accumulation of knowledge above all else appear constant and consistentâ”€the unchanging pillars of Sharlayan society.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_003570_YSHTOLA -- The very same period when Sharlayan scholars in the hinterlands began a formal study of the aetherial sea!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_003810_BARNIER -- Until further notice, the Students of Baldesion are to cease any and all activities within the domain of Sharlayan.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_006670_THANCRED -- It seems a quick trip back to Sharlayan is in order...

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_008310_ALPHINAUD -- Shall we depart for Sharlayan, then? I will see to it that the talismans arrive at the annex.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_008370_ALPHINAUD -- But he refused with a rather grim-faced â€œNo, thank you.â€� I suspect Sharlayan cuisine is not to his liking...

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06000_008400_ALISAIE -- Next time, I'll drag him out by the ear, sit him down in front of a Sharlayan feast, and see that he eats every last bite.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06001_000350_MONTICHAIGNE -- The enchantment which binds me and the rest of the Forum is based on a similar principle. And yes, it is a contravention of the Sharlayan prohibition against the practice of memory manipulation.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06001_000510_MONTICHAIGNE -- Oh, and I suggest you speak with Qih Aliapoh. She's well known among the artisans of Sharlayan, and her network of contacts may prove useful in your search for knowledge. I wish you all the best in your pursuits, wheresoever they may take you.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06002_002290_YSHTOLA -- Agreed. The Sharlayan Forum, yes?

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06002_002360_BARNIER -- This day we must speak of grave affairs and their implications for the future of Sharlayanâ”€nay, of this very star.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06002_002620_FOURCHENAULT -- The wisdom of Sharlayan has ever been a shining beacon in the darkness, and so it shall continue to be.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06002_002770_ALPHINAUD -- Though we cannot boast the boundless wisdom of Sharlayan, we have firsthand knowledge of foreign cultures, and have conversed with no small number of peoples.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06003_002890_FOURCHENAULT -- On behalf of the Forum of Sharlayan, I come with a proposal by which you, the people of Radz-at-Han, might be saved.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06003_003010_FOURCHENAULT -- And by our people, I speak not only of Sharlayan. We mean to save every man, woman, and child it is within our power to save.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06005_000590_PALAKASWOMANA -- Your offer to host us in Sharlayan is most appreciated, but will the Final Days not soon fall upon it as well?

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06005_000640_FOURCHENAULT -- Join us on our journey there and beyond, to new horizons. Come to Old Sharlayan. Please.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06005_001180_FOURCHENAULT -- I must visit Garlemald ere we return to Sharlayan. Having caused such an uproar, 'tis only meet that I explain myself to the Ilsabard contingent.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06005_001410_FOURCHENAULT -- I did... Though if you intend to again ask that Sharlayan alter its course, you will find my gratitude insufficient.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06005_001750_FOURCHENAULT -- As you have surmised, preparations for the exodus have not proceeded as smoothly as we had hoped. I should be happy to personally escort you to our headquarters in Sharlayan, where you may advise us as you deem fit.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06005_001980_FOURCHENAULT -- You are. It is for this purpose that Sharlayan has labored these many long years.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06005_002000_FOURCHENAULT -- Once that critical task has been accomplished, we will begin transporting the Sharlayan citizenry, which has been categorized into groups. The earliest arrivals are to ensure hospitable environs for those who come after.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06005_002950_SICARD -- (-Sicard-)I'll be in Ol' Sharlayan before you know it. Start mixing the grog!

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06005_003500_THANCRED -- Wilfsunn and Bloewyda. Sharlayan's foremost researchers in the field of teleportation magick. ...And Moenbryda's parents.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06005_004470_ERENVILLE -- I pray you do not interpret this as a betrayal of Sharlayan. I accept that the Forum's aim in pushing us to our limits was to preserve what knowledge we have, and I bear you no ill will for it.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06005_004950_FOURCHENAULT -- The Archon Louisoix openly decried Sharlayan's policies, a perspective which I regarded with increasing disdain as I grew older.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06006_001720_LIVINGWAY -- Oh, right, I was getting to that... From what I've read in Sharlayan tomes, it appears the Ascians incorporated an additional nasty element into their summoning method: the fervent desire to assimilate others into one's belief.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06006_005975_SYSTEM_NONE_VOICE -- Earlier, in Old Sharlayan...

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06006_007480_ZENOS -- When at last I understood what it was, I journeyed to Sharlayan to seek you out. Struck a bargain with the woman who shares your gift.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06006_009230_THANCRED -- We've no particular destination in mind, but we do intend to stop in Sharlayan before we set off.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06100_001270_GRAHATIA -- It would seem, however, that whatever wisdom she sought there was not to be found. She arrived in Sharlayan the other dayâ”€we spoke briefly before she began her search of Noumenon.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06100_003240_VARSHAHN -- Yes. Being great admirers of the Archons, House Daemir submitted detailed notes to Sharlayan's official committee. They expected praise and accolades for their simulacrum...and were thus devastated to be informed that their work had been classified as prohibited material.

TEXT_VOICEMAN_06100_003300_YSHTOLA -- In which case, I say we head directly to Sharlayan.

TEXT_XXAUSE103_03874_ALPHINAUD_000_013 -- F'lhaminn was her name, though you may know her better as the â€œSongstress of Ul'dah.â€� She was a performer of singular talent, and much beloved by the people of Eorzeaâ”€not to mention a certain Sharlayan minstrel.
