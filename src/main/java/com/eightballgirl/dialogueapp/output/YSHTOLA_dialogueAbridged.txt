 C>> Aye. Our suspicions were well founded. The Serpent Reavers are indeed the culprits.

 C>> Has there been any movement in Thanalan?

 C>> Then we have our explanation.

 C>> For the recent spate of crystal thefts in Thanalan. We naturally assumed that the trail would lead us back to the Amalj'aa.

 C>> Yet it did not. It led us across the sea unto Vylbrand.

 C>> That is the way of it, I fear.

 C>> Whilst conducting our investigation on behalf of the Mineral Concern, we came upon evidence implicating the Serpent Reavers.

 C>> With the aid of the Maelstrom, I was able to verify our suspicions. 'Tis only a matter of time before Leviathan returns to harrow the seas.

 C>> But there is more. One of the Sahagin--an elder, by my judgment--spoke of attaining the â€œgift and knowledge of eternity.â€�

 C>> Such a disturbance in the aether... If I did not know better, I should think this device defective.

 C>> And there is the explanation...

 C>> ...Whence comes this promise of immortality? The emissary?

 C>> We have outstayed our welcome.

 C>> Are the two of you quite well?

 C>> My lady--unless we act swiftly, Leviathan will rise again. The Admiral has already requested that we intervene to prevent this. Failing that, we are to attend to the primal's extermination.

 C>> Aye. A primal is about to be loosed upon Eorzea.

 C>> A godlike being whose very existence is a bane upon the land. We Scions of the Seventh Dawn are sworn to put an end to their kind.

 C>> It would be most welcome. When contending with a primal, one can never have too many able allies.

 C>> If you crave a more intimate understanding of the problems facing Eorzea, this experience is like to provide it. Be sure to come well prepared.

 C>> Damn them... They have made thralls of soldiers and civilians both...

 C>> The area was subsequently occupied by the Sahagin.

 C>> The Company of Heroes defeated Leviathan having first lured him into an inlet, but we must needs contend with him upon the open sea. It will avail us little to consult past experience.

 C>> Though you may labor to believe it, Thancred was once something of a scoundrel, who fraternized with the criminal class in these parts.

 C>> The better not to spoil the festive mood.

 C>> History repeats itself, Admiral. As the kobolds did before them, the Sahagin resorted to summoning their god over a territorial feud. They acted in self-preservation.

 C>> It may be that the Sahagin initiated this particular clash, but how it begins does not interest me so much as how it ends.

 C>> And so you kill, that you might live. Yet if living is a right, then that right belongs to all peoples, be they men or beastmen.

 C>> As must we all, Admiral. Stay the course, then, but know that it will lead to no good end.

 C>> Urianger. It is rare indeed to find you so far from a tome.

 C>> The disruption to the flow of aether was sudden and dramatic. So tangible was the agitation, I scarce had need of my goggles.

 C>> Quite. Even as the Sahagin elder fell to the Admiral's musket shot, I witnessed the release of an aetherial cloud which immediately took possession of a nearby minion.

 C>> The Sahagin ascended to an immortal state, but he did not possess a Crystal of Darkness through which to flee this realm. Thus was he consumed by Leviathan.

 C>> If we could entrap the spirits of defeated Ascians in like manner, and thereby deny them resurrection...

 C>> A joyous reunion indeed.

 C>> I barely succeeded in facilitating travel to an unattuned beacon. That which you describe sounds considerably more difficult.

 C>> Master Louisoix's writings make no mention of such a possibility. Can we be certain this entity was a primal?

 C>> Then mayhap it is time that we reexamined our previous encounters.

 C>> 'Twould seem more research is in order.

 C>> Indeed. I am reminded of the quantity of corrupted crystals required to thwart Leviathan, and the extraordinary lengths to which the Lominsans went to transport them. What if it should prove that a similar quantity was needed to destroy an Ascian soul--or still *more*...?

 C>> If you mean to tap the great river of aether, know that it will entail considerable risk. Meddling with the currents may well induce a surge like to the one which despoiled Mor Dhona.

 C>> What happened here? Where is Moenbryda?

 C>> Rather than await the inevitable, she took her fate into her own hands.

 C>> Shorn of its wards, the city will bear the full force of Nidhogg's fury.

 C>> How very convenient.

 C>> Thancred! Where have you been?

 C>> The careful preparations, the maneuvering of forces... I am inclined to agree with the General's insistence that a deeper plot exists here.

 C>> The architecture is of the Sil'dihn style, if I am not mistaken. The ancients plainly foresaw the need for a ready means of escape.

 C>> You two go on ahead. Thancred and I will deal with this.

 C>> Only that which is required to ensure that the dawn's light survive to brighten the morrow.

 C>> Leave us!

 C>> Numbers will count for little when I bring the tunnel down upon their heads. Though I cannot say I relish the thought of being entombed with you for all eternity.

 C>> 'Tis done!

 C>> Forgive me, Mhitra...

 C>> Tataru...

 C>> You are safe... Thank the Twelve.

 C>> Something has changed about you, Alphinaud. Or mayhap the change is with me? I seem to sense the aether around me more keenly than before.

 C>> Worry not. I am well enough.

 C>> That was my doing. I brought the tunnel down that you and Minfilia might escape.

 C>> At the last moment, I invoked a teleportation magick in hopes of spiriting Thancred away, at least. Needless to say, it did not go quite as planned, and I found myself adrift in the Lifestream.

 C>> The others--where are they? Did they not escape?

 C>> No apologies are necessary, Alphinaud--you are not to blame for what occurred. Know that were our comrades here, they would commend you for keeping the light of hope alive.

 C>> Ha! There is the Alphinaud I remember--and I feel much the better for his return! 'Tis time I arose!

 C>> Tataru has apprised me of all that took place in the aftermath of the assassination plot. It would seem I have been away for some while.

 C>> And you want for some manner of aetheric ram to pierce the floating isle's protective barrier.

 C>> A means to prise open a hole in an Allagan barrier--and one large enough to admit an airship, no less... Hm... Nay. I lack the knowledge to devise such a weapon.

 C>> ...But I know of one who could.

 C>> A leading figure in the field of aetheric research, and one of the finest scholars ever to grace Sharlayan--Matoya, my former master.

 C>> Though we neglected to knock, we *did* create something of a commotion. I had hoped that would suffice.

 C>> To give credit where credit is due--I learned from the best. It has been too long, Master Matoya.

 C>> You are familiar with it?

 C>> You will help us, then? Truly? I had not anticipated such an impassioned response. Could it be that the presence of young blood has stirred your own?

 C>> Ah, yes, a device which draws in aether and concentrates it to produce a destructive force.

 C>> Do mine ears deceive? 'Twas you, was it not, who was so fond of saying that all knowledge exists to advance mankind? That how it is used depends on us?

 C>> With respect, Master--the fruits of your research should not be left to spoil. Will you share with us the secrets of the aetheric converger?

 C>> You were not exaggerating when you said that you had sealed it away. Though the city is abandoned, the library's guardians are all but certain to remain. We must needs cut a path through them. Come--let us away.

 C>> If only we had white auracite and the aetheric siphon...

 C>> Would that there were another ready wellspring of energy for us to draw upon...

 C>> Then it is settled. Let us return to the Holy See at once.

 C>> I might have known that it would not escape your notice. It has been this way since I returned from the Lifestream. An aftereffect of the teleportation magick I invoked, most like.

 C>> I have no regrets. I but did what was necessary to preserve the light of hope--to keep my promise to Minfilia.

 C>> Besides, it afforded me the rare opportunity to wander the aether--a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

 C>> I will, Master Matoya. And thank you.

 C>> Until but recently, the Ishgardians had kept their doors firmly shut to outsiders.

 C>> But thanks to you, we have found in them stout allies, with whom we may fight to secure the future of the realm. Truly, you are the beacon of hope towards which all men are drawn.

 C>> Oh? In light of all we have achieved, I felt it only meet to express my gratitude.

 C>> 'Twas not mine intent to make light of your struggle. If I have given offense, then I apologize. But if I may speak freely, you would do well to be wary of the Eye. Even now, it burns with insatiable hatred, watching unblinking for a sign of weakness. Should you falter for so much as a moment, it will surely consume you.

 C>> White auracite... But whence did it come?

 C>> This aether... It was a Crystal of Light.

 C>> She, too, was one of Hydaelyn's chosen...

 C>> So that is their purpose.

 C>> Imprisoning a primal in such a manner would represent an effective means to halt the cycle of summoning--were it not for the grave and obvious risks.

 C>> Held in duress, a primal will continue to nurse its hatred for mankind. And when it inevitably breaks free, its rage will be beyond quelling.

 C>> It would seem we have no choice.

 C>> Enough talk! Make haste and stop the archbishop!

 C>> It would seem <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> has done it again.

 C>> Where is Estinien?

 C>> But he and his knights are no more, thanks to the Warrior of Light.

 C>> Because they *care*, Master Garlond.

 C>> You need not apologize. We arrived but a moment ago ourselves.

 C>> Pray allow me to introduce Krile, who is recently come from the Sharlayan motherland. She has generously offered to assist us.

 C>> I gather you have new information to share with us?

 C>> Then let us all call on her forthwith. I think it best that you explain your plan to her in person.

 C>> Forgive us, Master Matoya. We will be sure to wipe them on the way out. And may I say how glad I am that age has not yet deprived you of your senses.

 C>> Long did I ponder the nature of this crystal and its familiar radiance...but never did I suspect it was a Crystal of Light.

 C>> Have care. The aether moves strangely around him.

 C>> SHORT DEFENDING EXHALATION - SHOULD NOT DISPLAY

 C>> SHORT DEFENDING EXHALATION - SHOULD NOT DISPLAY

 C>> Suffice it to say, our reunion was not at all as I pictured it. Waiting until the last instant to join the fray. 'Tis plain you have not lost your appetite for the dramatic.

 C>> Thancred...

 C>> And thence did you conclude that were you to track the primal's movements, it would surely bring you into contact with the Scions once more.

 C>> Nor am I. Krile?

 C>> Must you be so ungentle!?

 C>> I know the truth of which you speak, and have from the first.

 C>> If the Ascians will go to any lengths to resurrect their god, then we must needs be as committed to our cause--to unmask them and their schemes, and to crush them both utterly.

 C>> Come. There is much to be done.

 C>> Think not too deeply on Master Matoya's words. Her intent was but to steel our resolve.

 C>> That, and to remind us to look beyond these passing conflicts to trials greater still--to the truth which hides at the heart of this world.

 C>> You disapprove?

 C>> Indeed. But 'twas not to soothe our humours that we gathered here.

 C>> Pray cast your mind back to the moment of Estinien's transformation. Do you recall how you described it to us?

 C>> You spoke of the sudden pangs which racked his body when he took up both of Nidhogg's eyes--and of how his form was twisted thereafter into a shadowy semblance of the great wyrm.

 C>> Would that only his armor had been corrupted... Snaking forth from the eyes, I descried dark tendrils which entangled his very being. His aether has been all but smothered.

 C>> Yes. 'Tis like that Estinien's spirit yet lingers.

 C>> We know not if that would serve to separate wyrm's soul from man's. None have ever attempted such a feat.

 C>> 'Twould seem duty calls. Pray see to yours, and we shall return to ours.

 C>> I take it your mission was a success?

 C>> You were following these people, Alisaie. Why?

 C>> ...We cannot let that happen.

 C>> Agreed. Krile and I shall journey to Xelphatol and learn what we can of the Ixal's source.

 C>> Companions bound by a common purpose, free to go whither they will... The idea is not without merit.

 C>> Very well. I shall resume my research of the primals and the elder gods of Eorzea. Should anyone have need of my findings, you need only ask.

 C>> I should be glad of your continued assistance.

 C>> The path behind us was fraught with hardship, and the path before us will be no less unforgiving. But a new dawn *shall* break over the realm, and I see before me the faces of those who will deliver it.

 C>> Should none of our number step forward, must we then constrain some unwilling candidate to take up the position?

 C>> Krile, a hand if you would. Let us see about closing these wounds.

 C>> Agreed. I shall depart for Limsa Lominsa forthwith and seek an audience with the Admiral. Thancred--Ul'dah is yours.

 C>> Alphinaud and Alisaie--make haste to the Twelveswood, and notify the Elder Seedseer of the danger to Gridania. She will duly call a council of the Alliance leaders, whom you must be ready to receive.

 C>> You will be our voice in Ishgard. Explain the situation to Ser Aymeric, and encourage him to send an envoy.

 C>> Tataru, Krile--I leave the care of our injured messenger to you. See that she remains quiescent and her wounds closed.

 C>> I believe that covers everything. Let us be about our tasks.

 C>> You need not have worried--the battle took place far above the ground. We were able to observe in relative safety, though I am given to understand that there were casualties on the far side of the Wall.

 C>> She is up on the platform, lost in thought. We deemed it best not to disturb her, but mayhap she would welcome some company after all. Shall we?

 C>> Yda, there is no need to explain.

 C>> She was your inspiration. Is that not why you took up her mask and her name? ...Or did you simply mean to continue what she had started?

 C>> Of course. We all recognized you at once. 'Twas Papalymo who persuaded us to maintain the charade.

 C>> And what of the primal and Omega?

 C>> ...They would have us act as intermediaries?

 C>> I too shall accompany you. Such endeavors are seldom hampered by a surfeit of healers.

 C>> Lyse, run!

 C>> How...

 C>> Am I to understand that you summoned us all--some of us still nursing wounds--to hear this?

 C>> Hahaha! Forgive me, Lyse! 'Twas but a jest.

 C>> But this I say with the utmost sincerity: Scion or no, we are comrades.
Now and ever after.

 C>> Is that not so?

 C>> There you have it. Come what may, you may count on us in your hour of need. We shall never refuse you.

 C>> Warmachina. It would seem they were involved in a struggle.

 C>> There may be clues. We should split up and search the area.

 C>> Handpicked soldiers answering only to the royal family...

 C>> Lyse! What brings you here?

 C>> Whichever Ascian, you mean. We all know the nature of our adversary.

 C>> ...It may even seem practical.

 C>> Under the guidance of our former leader, Master Louisoix, we once strove to unite the fractious cityâ€“states of Eorzea. I daresay that experience shall be of use in your endeavor.

 C>> ...Not if we deny them access to the skies.

 C>> During our time in the Burn, the Warrior of Light and I chanced upon some Allagan ruins.

 C>> As such ruins go, they were not particularly unusual, but something about the surrounding land struck me as odd. Faint though it was, its aetherial residue was uncannily similar to that of Azys Lla. Identical, in fact.

 C>> For locations so far removed to share a single aetheric signature is all but impossible. I conclude therefore that the Allagans created the floating continent with land taken from the Burn.

 C>> Azys Lla was enclosed in a powerful energy barrier, impenetrable even to an Agrius-class battleship.

 C>> It occurred to me that those ruins may have enjoyed similar protection. I have no proof, but the Warrior of Light *did* report seeing a structure resembling other known Allagan field generators.

 C>> It occurred to me that those ruins may have enjoyed similar protection. I have no proof, but the Warrior of Light *did* report seeing a structure resembling other known Allagan field generators.

 C>> A word of caution. Even assuming the generator still functions, raising a barrier of such a scale will require a prodigious amount of energy.

 C>> And few places are so bereft of suitable crystals as the Burn.

 C>> A curious question. Besides Azys Lla, I know of only one other notable instance: the red moon Dalamud, whose fall triggered the Calamity.

 C>> But not his purpose, I trust.

 C>> Might this be a fitting moment to tell us what we are doing here?

 C>> A tainted land cloven from the earth, and an offering of blood to the heavens... Azys Lla and Dalamud.

 C>> And you believe that yonder mountains hide an artifact possessed of sufficient power to raise Azys Lla up to the heavens. ...I suppose that might suffice.

 C>> I would.

 C>> Such an abundance of aether!

 C>> We are. This is an Allagan artifact, most likely built to regulate the flow of aether.

 C>> I strongly suspect the ancients used it to stem the flow from here to the Burn. That would explain how they were able to untether what became Azys Lla from its surroundings.

 C>> But were we to throw open the floodgates, the resultant deluge would surely be sufficient to raise our wall. And in restoring the flow, we may also restore life to the wasteland.

 C>> Hm...?

 C>> While the device itself harbors a surfeit of aether, the opposite is true of the surrounding area...

 C>> An effect of regulation, perhaps? A similar phenomenon seemed to be occurring in Doma...

 C>> Whatever the explanation, the answer will not reveal itself here. We have seen what we needed to see. Let us return to Mol Iloh.

 C>> Is this truly necessary? Have you no peaceable way of making decisions?

 C>> ...Well, they do not want for conviction.

 C>> Constantly at each other's throats, like rabid...dogs. Gods, I'm turning into her.

 C>> Ahem. I have not the patience for this. But if we must fight, let us at least be brief. Come!

 C>> Y'shtola. Why?

 C>> I beg your pardon?

 C>> I am...not interested, little sun. Try again when you have become a man.

 C>> We have wasted enough time here. Cirina waits for word of our success.

 C>> It did. Aether may flow freely to the Burn once more.

 C>> You have an idea?

 C>> Is it over?

 C>> Alisaie and I heard a voice in the moments before Thancred collapsed. It was accompanied by a severe headache--as if something were clutching at our minds. Did you experience the same thing?

 C>> Called?

 C>> Forgive us, Lyse, but may we leave Thancred in your care for a time?

 C>> Thank you, Lyse.

 C>> As the Elder Seedseer says, 'tis no ordinary individual we are dealing with. Nor can we discount the possibility of Ascian involvement.

 C>> You heard it too, then?

 C>> Who do you think is responsible? Could this be the Ascians' doing?

 C>> One other thing. During my visit to the Far East, I observed a strange phenomenon.

 C>> Well, that spares me the trouble of an explanation. Yes. I noted precisely that at two apparently unconnected locations. I take it the phenomenon is not limited to the Far East?

 C>> If the same phenomenon is being observed in multiple locations on opposite sides of the world, we may safely discount regional factors. Needless to say, this warrants further investigation.

 C>> I...I hear it too!

 C>> (-???-)Enough. Runar, report.

 C>> The intense light of the aether I saw was unmistakable. If not sin eaters, then what?

 C>> Nay. I recognize you, Urianger, Thancred. And this is Minfilia of the First, of whom you spoke before.

 C>> First explain this other presence in your company. The one I know not.

 C>> There is but one manner of creature in this world whose aether is suffused with such an abundance of light.

 C>> It... It cannot be!

 C>> Lower your weapons.

 C>> Forgive us this hostile welcome.

 C>> Come, I would give you a proper introduction to Rak'tika and its people.

 C>> Slitherbough is the largest of the Blessed's settlements.

 C>> They worship no gods, instead revering Darkness itself.

 C>> It is a curious kind of faith, but one which has granted them the strength to persevere in the wake of the Flood.

 C>> I hope you weren't expecting a grand feast by way of welcome. They are a simple people.

 C>> Now, I would hear of your travels away from prying ears. Come.

 C>> I see. And now you seek the Lightwarden of Rak'tika.

 C>> In the days after I arrived in the First, I too relied upon the Crystal Exarch for guidance. But his penchant for secrecy and the telling of half-truths soon lost him my trust. And thus did I strike out on my own.

 C>> My work eventually led me here to the forest, which I have come to know like the back of my hand.

 C>> I cannot say with certainty where your quarry is hiding, but I am confident I can narrow the search.

 C>> Some few thousand years ago, this forest stood at the heart of the empire of Ronka.

 C>> A great many relics of that civilization can still be found to the east in Yx'Maja.

 C>> Or rather, *could* be found--were the area not fiercely guarded.

 C>> Yx'Maja, you see, is home to a tribe of warriors whose lineage is said to date back to the time of the empire. Any attempt to enter their territory is met with lethal force. They offer no warnings, and suffer no trespasser to escape.

 C>> Needless to say, my every attempt to survey the area has been thwarted.

 C>> As for the tablet...

 C>> I find the timing of its discovery suspiciously convenient. If I did not know better, I would think someone was trying to curry favor with me.

 C>> Regardless, it will take time to decipher these writings. Yet I would not be at all surprised if they somehow held the key to entering Yx'Maja unmolested. The Exarch has a nose for serendipity.

 C>> Thank you, Urianger. I may well take you up on that offer.

 C>> While we set to work, might I suggest you take a tour of the city?

 C>> Should you be in any doubt as to the importance of your role as the â€œWarrior of Darkness,â€� the people here will surely cure you of it.

 C>> Lest you forget, Master Matoya and I dedicated our lives to uncovering the truth which hides at the heart of our world.

 C>> Though separate, the fate of this reflection is nevertheless bound to that of our home. That I would be daunted by such an invaluable opportunity is absurd.

 C>> But what of you, Thancred? Could it be that you are still struggling to â€œcome to termsâ€� with the nature of your young companion?

 C>> Understands, perhaps, but does not accept. The question being whether he ever will.

 C>> And whether *you* will, more importantly. As difficult as your circumstances may be, they are yours, not his. 'Tis you and you alone who bears ultimate responsibility for your life.

 C>> But you need not make any hard choices now. Why not go and get some fresh air--clear your head?

 C>> It seemed only right that we show our faces. May we join you?

 C>> That vessel represents the night sky. The â€œsunless sea of heaven.â€�

 C>> I am told you assisted in the preparations for the service. On behalf of the Blessed, you have my sincerest thanks.

 C>> The enduring legend of the Warrior of Darkness owes much to the traditions of these people.

 C>> And none were more ardent in their faith than Toddia. She would have been greatly moved by your presence.

 C>> Mayhap sooner than later, in fact. 

 C>> Urianger and I have finished deciphering the tablet, and its contents were most illuminating. Let us reconvene in my chambers. We have much to discuss.

 C>> There you are. I have everything I need. Let us quit this place.

 C>> Is something the matter? We should go. The others are waiting.

 C>> I tire of these games, Urianger. Why do you pretend you cannot see it!?

 C>> The blessing may spare <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> the fate of becoming a Lightwarden...

 C>> But you cannot be blind to the nascent corruption! <If(PlayerParameter(4))>She<Else/>He</If> is not as <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> was in the Source.

 C>> Though I have no proof, I fear that the light which poured forth from the Wardens was not negated at all.

 C>> I fear it was *absorbed*--that <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> has been suffused with their light.

 C>> (SIGH)

 C>> By the time you deign to enlighten us, it may be too late--if it is not already.

 C>> Urianger--I know full well, after all these years, that you have only the best of intentions.

 C>> But that does not make it any easier to put my faith in a man so infatuated with secrecy.

 C>> I have had my suspicions ever since the Exarch bade you speak that day, but now I must ask.

 C>> The Eighth Umbral Calamity and all that followed; everything you claimed to have seen--did you?

 C>> I do.

 C>> I presume *that* is your doing.

 C>> If you have come to parley, I must insist that you first return him to us.

 C>> Is that so...

 C>> And the Children of the Everlasting Dark have acquiesced to this madness?

 C>> You have accepted the yoke of Eulmore to spite us, then? Fools. Darkness will never return to these skies while they hold sway.

 C>> And should we refuse?

 C>> We will discuss these developments after I have tended to our casualty.

 C>> 'Twould seem we have found them.

 C>> Wait! We did not come to--

 C>> (BLOCKING GRUNT)

 C>> Stop! We mean you no harm!

 C>> We are allies of the empire of Ronka. As is customary, we come bearing the seal of the emperor.

 C>> "Follow the flowers...â€œ Would it kill them to escort us?

 C>> But if it affords us an opportunity to investigate Yx'Maja...fine.

 C>> It seems to be working!

 C>> I think not!

 C>> Expertly done.

 C>> Do not fail.

 C>> (WAKING UP REAX)

 C>> Yes... Though I cannot imagine how. What happened?

 C>> I wanted to save the antidote, and after that...

 C>> (SUDDEN LAUGH)

 C>> I did something exceedingly reckless. For which you will just have to forgive me.

 C>> (SHOCK REAX)

 C>> Please, Runar, dry your tears. What would the others think if they saw you like this?

 C>> Come now--did you really think I would go gently into that dark night with so much left undone? So many mysteries left unsolved?

 C>> I see.

 C>> Thank you. Differences notwithstanding, you saved my life, and for that I am grateful.

 C>> But let us turn our attention to more important matters, such as the Qitana Ravel.

 C>> You had better not have explored its depths without me.

 C>> It does. Though <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> shows no immediate signs of corruption, the danger remains. <If(PlayerParameter(4))>She<Else/>He</If> must be told.

 C>> ...Would you describe it to me, Urianger? Paint for me a picture with your words.

 C>> I can see it...

 C>> Well fought. Let us return home.

 C>> The murals. If I am not mistaken, they predate the empire.

 C>> A peculiarity of the paint. Most are made from mineral-based pigments, but whatever was used here is older than anything I have ever seen.

 C>> According to Almet, this sanctuary was built to preserve the wisdom of the ancients. What events do these murals commemorate, I wonder?

 C>> You're plotting something.

 C>> Then share with us the stories you know so well. We are listening.

 C>> Zodiark!?

 C>> You have spun quite a tale.

 C>> Yet you have not explained the role of the Ascians in all of this. How is it you are privy to ancient secrets lost to time?

 C>> You needn't worry about us. What became of the Eulmoran soldiers, more importantly?

 C>> I suppose you're not entirely wrong...

 C>> But we are not worthy of your reverence, nor have we any desire to be worshipped. If you would pray, pray for your children, that they may one day know a better world.

 C>> I am sorry, Runar, but there is still much to be done, and scant time in which to do it.

 C>> We must go--all of us. For we share the same path and the same fate.

 C>> Even should we all join in the endeavor, an exhaustive search could take weeks--and with no guarantee of finding anything.

 C>> She will need a name.

 C>> A name of her own. I would not have her walk in the shadow of another any longer.

 C>> And I think it a fitting tribute to our departed friend too. At the mention of Minfilia, I would remember the woman who preserved our fellowship when all seemed lost.

 C>> Then we must think of a new name. Suggestions?

 C>> Back to Kholusia. The last refuge of Light.

 C>> Do you hear? Your dreamed-of Rejoining is in jeopardy. Are you sure you're not tempted to intervene?

 C>> And the two beings waged war until, with a single, devastating blow, Hydaelyn unmade Zodiark, scattering his being across space and time. So you told us in the Qitana Ravel.

 C>> From a purely Ascian standpoint, it could be said that what you seek to do is only logical.

 C>> But that would be to ignore the immeasurable destruction wrought with each Rejoining. You have murdered millions. And this we cannot condone.

 C>> There's something I need Ryne to see.

 C>> This was among the townsfolk's food stores.

 C>> So it is.

 C>> In limited quantities, it may have little effect on an average individual.

 C>> Yet if one were to consume it regularly, over a period of several years, I suspect it would do far, far more than merely nourish the body...

 C>> Vauthry has fled to Mt. Gulg, and we mean to pursue him. Do any of you know the way?

 C>> We will contemplate flight only as a last resort. Were we to come under attack whilst airborne, we would have little hope of defending ourselves.

 C>> If at all possible, we would prefer to travel by land. Is there a way?

 C>> The lady may well have the right of it.

 C>> Mt. Gulg will not soon come down to earth, nor can we compel it to do so. But if the mountain will not come to the land, mayhap the land may be made to come to the mountain...

 C>> ...In the form of a Talos. A Talos large enough to reach out and take the volcano in its grasp.

 C>> Many among the Night's Blessed are gifted in the arcane arts. I will recruit them to our cause.

 C>> So, as you can see, you will not want for bodies. I trust you will have your design ready in good time for their arrival.

 C>> Norvrandt is counting on you...heir to Daedalus Stoneworks.

 C>> Word from the Exarch. All is set on his side, and we may proceed when ready.

 C>> Let us begin. See that everyone is in position.

 C>> We shall catch Vauthry, mountain and all!

 C>> He seems disinclined to grant us an audience.

 C>> Twelve forfend, he cannot contain the Light. He's beginning to turn!

 C>> Twelve forfend, she cannot contain the Light. She's beginning to turn!

 C>> Urianger! If you've aught up your sleeve, now is the time!

 C>> You knew of this, Urianger.

 C>> 'Tis all a fiction. Such vaguely defined acts of teleportation stand no chance of success.

 C>> The Exarch will never live to see another world--as he knows only too well.

 C>> He means to take the Light with him into the rift...where he will die.

 C>> He means to take the Light with him into the rift...where he will die.

 C>> From the beginning, he intended to sacrifice himself to save our friend and Norvrandt.

 C>> Indeed, we have exhausted every other avenue.

 C>> Lead and we shall follow. If there *is* any hope to be found, then we will surely find it at your side.

 C>> You might have invited them to join us, were there not so many. But come, they are waiting. What is your will, O Warrior of Darkness?

 C>> It seems we've succeeded in gaining their trust.

 C>> You have completed your devotions?

 C>> Then...we are seeing the same view.

 C>> The remnants in the Ondo settlement were solid, material structures, but these...

 C>> Everything here pulses with aether. 'Tis an enchantment on a monumental scale!

 C>> It is not *<If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If>* who is lost without the familiar.

 C>> Not content with remaking an entire city, you aim to fill it with the reconstituted souls of the dead.

 C>> It is true that all we hold dear is fated to fade away.

 C>> But that is no reason for us to forsake it!

 C>> Such...*infernal*...strength...

 C>> His aether... It is...it is as it used to be.

 C>> Her aether... It is...it is as it used to be.

 C>> As a disciple of Zodiark, the Ascian was the Darkness to your Light...

 C>> I can but assume that when you set your strength against his, the Light within you was spent.

 C>> He'll wash up sooner or later.

 C>> And with that triumph, the future from which you came will no longer come to pass... Yet, here you still stand.

 C>> I imagine we each have matters demanding our attention, so let this be a farewell for us all.

 C>> Send word when you've resummoned our friend.

 C>> Oh, and do try to ensure <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> arrives *within* the city next time.

 C>> Will Thancred and Ryne not be joining us?

 C>> Yet our souls seem unaffected. To my eye, at least.

 C>> How long they will remain so is another question. Krile is right. It is imperative we find a way to return to the Source.

 C>> Your followers await your divine judgment.

 C>> [Report if label displays]

 C>> If the two of you have finished, perhaps we could return to our discussion?

 C>> Rather than dwelling upon the multiple failed attempts at transference, I think it would behoove us to focus on the solitary success.

 C>> I would draw your attention to the fact that our friend can travel between worlds possessed not only of [his/her] body and soul, but [his/her] personal effects besides.

 C>> This is no different from the teleportation magicks to which we are all accustomed--magicks that allow for the transportation of those inanimate objects one considers to be an extension of oneself.

 C>> While this is indeed a worrying development, I think the state of the Empire as a whole greater grounds for concern.

 C>> With the Emperor slain and Zenos returned, it is impossible to predict how matters will unfold in Garlemald. The Ultima Weapon may be but the first of many unpleasant surprises.

 C>> A gift that lives on only through the blood of the Allagan emperors...which certainly does not flow within auracite, or any other crystal.

 C>> They *would* be more inclined to take the word of the Warrior of Darkness.

 C>> What in the world...?

 C>> Nor I. To my eyes, your aether burns as brightly as the day you slew Emet-Selch. That is proof that he is with you still.

 C>> That he is an Ascian.

 C>> Assuming then that this is indeed the work of an Ascian, my mind inevitably turns to the last remaining Paragon to survive the sundering...

 C>> And they have gained much by it. Emet-Selch single-handedly built the Garlean Empire in this manner, while Lahabrea came close to conquering Eorzea having taken possession of Thancred's living body.

 C>> Is it not peculiar, then, that Ardbert's mortal remains should be susceptible, given that he was once a Warrior of Light? Or did the final departure of his soul make it possible, perhaps?

 C>> Regardless, to hear an Ascian use him to call forth new Warriors of Light boggles the mind.

 C>> The people of Ronka are known to have venerated animals, but these features do not match those of any indigenous species. This is no common beast.

 C>> Though that much is plain from its proportions.

 C>> This owl, by contrast, seems no different from the others we've seen.

 C>> Too simple. There will be some additional defense mechanism.

 C>> Just a moment--there are words carved into the stone.

 C>> He...who would disturb...a hero's deserved slumber...

 C>> Shall instead...waken the beast...and know...his folly...

 C>> Wait! Don't!

 C>> Why am I not surprised? Prepare yourselves!

 C>> 'Twould seem the magicks have returned us. How polite.

 C>> Now, what have we learned?

 C>> â€œHe who would disturb a hero's deserved slumber...â€�

 C>> A tomb, just as I thought. Befitting a hero.

 C>> I wonder...

 C>> By the light...of fallen stars...great power awakens...

 C>> Naught less than the Echo.

 C>> In which case...none of this is mere coincidence.

 C>> A shower of stars setting the sky aflame--and in both this world and the Source, we find individuals within whom a mysterious power awakened at the sight.

 C>> We could never unpick the why of it. Now, however...I believe we might.

 C>> Does the scene depicted here not resemble the one we saw when we first ventured into the Qitana Ravel?

 C>> Moreover, does it not recall that which Emet-Selch invited us to witness in Amaurot?

 C>> The Final Days.

 C>> If, as the Exarch's research suggests, soul and mind share a fragile yet profound bond, might it not be possible for an event to leave such a deep imprint upon the soul that it could be perceived eons later--given a suitable trigger?

 C>> The Echo defies explanation by conventional aetherological theory. Or shall we say, modern aetherological theory.

 C>> But if it is a power that once belonged to the ancients, to souls yet undivided...

 C>> ...Ah.

 C>> It would seem I have entered the realm of pure speculation. And I call myself a scholar.

 C>> I shall refrain from making any further wild claims until such time as I have evidence.

 C>> Still, I cannot choose but be reminded of our experience in Amaurot...

 C>> â€œRemember us.â€�

 C>> Your mothers were wise.

 C>> Though we witnessed the Final Days, our impressions could not fail to be colored by our own experiences and expectations. Those who lived through it would have perceived the event quite differently.

 C>> We must bear in mind that it is no simple matter to keep the truth alive, or it will die with Emet-Selch and his kin.

 C>> But we have disturbed Tiuna long enough. Fanow will serve similarly well as a venue for our contemplations.

 C>> It is heartening to have all present.

 C>> None better understood your plight than he. His words must surely be worthy of your consideration.

 C>> Wait!

 C>> Another visit to the Tempest may shed some light upon these mysteries.

 C>> Whether we are to exchange words or blows with Elidibus at our next meeting, the fact remains: we know too little.

 C>> Ere our paths cross again, I would learn more of the world that once was--and of Elidibus himself.

 C>> In this, we would be best served going directly to his home, much as Emet-Selch came to ours.

 C>> I quite agree. Yet the ruins of the actual city remain unexplored.

 C>> Given the vastness of the Tempest, I should not be surprised were there more such structures like to those in which the Ondo reside.

 C>> A <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> after my own heart.

 C>> Mayhap your skepticism will leaven my curiosity.

 C>> Keep that up and I'll send you to bed without supper.

 C>> This structure must have served an important function. And here are yet more crystals...

 C>> So...it was they who first summoned Hydaelyn.

 C>> And that this place, in all likelihood, served as their headquarters. The presence of such intimate records attests to that.

 C>> I would hear what else they have to tell us. All of it. Did anyone see the source of the image?

 C>> The device there? Then let us see what other secrets it holds.

 C>> What?

 C>> Forgive me, but did that not strongly imply that Elidibus sacrificed himself to become Zodiark's heart?

 C>> (-???-)Have you finished?

 C>> My apologies. I freed myself as soon as I awoke, but rather too late, I see.

 C>> Now, Elidibus, if you have ceased trading blows, I would trade words with you.

 C>> I have a theory, you see--one concerning that which you seek to accomplish.

 C>> It stems from who--or rather *what*--you truly are: a primal.

 C>> The ancients created Zodiark to deliver the star from destruction.

 C>> If the magick that brought Him forth is the precursor of what we know as summoning, then Zodiark would have been instilled with a presiding desire...

 C>> I found it among the records at Anyder. And it came as no surprise. Were I faced with the world's destruction, I too would wish for the same...

 C>> Salvation.

 C>> I know that you sacrificed yourself to become Zodiark's heart.

 C>> How you came to be separated from Him is less clear...

 C>> But if you are a fragment of His being, it stands to reason a desire for the world's salvation would drive you.

 C>> And thus did you seek to inspire the masses to rise up as Warriors of Light, going so far as to use Ardbert as a symbol of hope.

 C>> Then you will be all too familiar with the fickleness of mankind.

 C>> We change. We forget. And what little we do remember becomes twisted and fragmented over time. For which reason, you deem us unfit to carry on your legacy.

 C>> But are you yourself free of these foibles? As the last witness of the Final Days, do you remember *everything* that was lost? Or even the things you cared about?

 C>> A primal is shaped by the hope that fuels it. Even should this hope be something as simple as the world's salvation, it is the collective desire of innumerable disparate souls crying out for deliverance.

 C>> Having drawn your strength from such a cacophony of voices, can you truly be sure you still speak with your own?

 C>> I was wondering where you had disappeared to.

 C>> Is something troubling you?

 C>> ...No? Very well.

 C>> I have everything. Let's hurry back to the surface.

 C>> Forgive us our lateness.

 C>> Master Chai, my congratulations on your appointment. By all accounts, you are a capable mayor.

 C>> The credit for that lies with my own capable friend, without whom I might never have escaped my abductor.

 C>> They are not of flesh and blood.

 C>> The aether churns around us. More of them will appear ere long.

 C>> To stay would only place innocents in harm's way. We must fight this battle elsewhere.

 C>> You are a capable leader in your own right, Master Chai. The citizens of Eulmore chose well.

 C>> They come!

 C>> Brave and selfless as ever. Yet the two of you may struggle to fool our foes, aetherically sensitive as they are.

 C>> Had you a comrade who could use destructive magicks to wreak havoc upon the ambient aether, on the other hand...

 C>> Rest assured I have no intention of expending any of mine this day.

 C>> Runar... Please...

 C>> No subtitles. Report if displayed.

 C>> And you in mine.

 C>> Remember that your people's journey--that *our* people's journey is yet ongoing. Your lives will change, and so too will your dreams. Yet come what may, you need not forsake your time-honored traditions, nor less your beliefs.

 C>> But neither should you be beholden to them. For it was with curiosity and courage that the Night's Blessed first triumphed over adversity. New knowledge and new wisdom are ever worthy of pursuit.

 C>> That is well. But however great your strides, there may yet come a day when the challenges you face cannot be surmounted alone.

 C>> On such a day...

 C>> No subtitles. Report if displayed.

 C>> You may call on me.

 C>> Since a means to travel between worlds exists, you can be sure I will find a way to employ it.

 C>> And there remain so many mysteries here that want for solving.

 C>> No subtitles. Report if displayed.

 C>> I daresay we have all the good wishes we can carry. Let us be on our way.

 C>> No subtitles. Report if displayed.

 C>> Thank you. My body feels like a sack of popotoes, but otherwise I have never felt better.

 C>> That said, I doubt any of us will be fit to travel for some while. May we leave the rest to you?

 C>> No less impressive than our garments. You've outdone yourself, Tataru.

 C>> I will join the fray when I've finished my tea.

 C>> For DE and FR only. Report if displayed.

 C>> A difficult truth to bear, yes. But at last we understand the nature of our adversary. And if there are no further calamities, neither will there be Rejoinings, meaning Zodiark will never regain His full strength.

 C>> Even so, as the oldest and mightiest of primals, He remains a force to be feared.

 C>> Though His is a power born of the desire for salvation, we have seen the havoc it may wreak. And it falls to us to ensure that it is never again brought to bear upon this star.

 C>> Rest assured there'll be many, many more. Go on, lend Alisaie a hand.

 C>> For DE and FR only. Report if displayed.

 C>> Mind? I'm sure they would be glad of your company. Pray enjoy your time together with your hero.

 C>> We were, and came here for a meeting on the subject. Certain pirate factions did not deign to attend, however, and it was canceled.

 C>> So this new magick, adapted from memory transference, would be used to purge the subject of their fanatical faith, while Angelo would be responsible for reanimating the aether of their soul... Hm.

 C>> Yet I wonder at the practicalities. If one were to reanimate the soul first, it would only serve to exacerbate the tempering. Conversely, a stagnant soul would not respond to the effects of the magick.

 C>> Would both need to be performed simultaneously?

 C>> As would I. Since the resumption of our duties, it has been naught but stuffy meetings, and I have ample aether to spare.

 C>> The treatment--did it work?

 C>> Yet there *is* an authority on familiars to whom we may grudgingly turn. She's stubborn, haughty, eccentric, irascible, laconic, annoying--and her name is Master Matoya. The real one.

 C>> They were too busy teaching me aetherology, Master. Jesting aside, I wanted to be the one to express our gratitude.

 C>> I am told you spared no effort to sustain our bodies while we were away. And for that we owe you our lives. Thank you.

 C>> It wasn't easy to leave, as it happens. Seldom does one have the opportunity to study other worlds, and I would not have minded extending my stay by a handful of years.

 C>> I merely adopted an alias in accordance with the custom of my hosts. Yours just happened to be the first name that came to mind.

 C>> Indeed. And devoted pupil that I am, I could not fail to recall my master's sage advice: â€œWhen the answer eludes you, look to the wisdom of your elders.â€�

 C>> I will require a moment before I try again.

 C>> Agreed. Though I must leave this errand to you. I doubt my legs will carry me out of the cave, much less to Vylbrand.

 C>> Thank you for taking the lead in gathering the ingredients. I expect you would benefit from a rest too.

 C>> If I said yes, would it persuade you to treat me like an adult?

 C>> Mayhap they do not. If mere proximity to the towers is enough to make loyal servants of the Empire's mortal enemies, it stands to reason that the same is true for those held captive.

 C>> They invoke their gods for the good of Garlemald, and in their disturbed state of mind summon a primal whose form reflects their own alteration.

 C>> May these words ever be our guide, Your Grace.

 C>> We were wondering: when was the last time Hydaelyn spoke to you directly?

 C>> When you regained Her blessing, was it not? But never since--not in all your time in the First, when you faced the unsundered, the very heart of Zodiark.

 C>> When Elidibus sought to make Warriors of Light? That was the voice which calls constantly to all who might hear it. I spoke of *direct* communication, when Hydaelyn communed solely with you. A far rarer occurrence.

 C>> Is the question truly so vexing? Perhaps you fear I will chastise you for giving the wrong answer? Or was it so long ago that you simply can't remember...

 C>> Mayhap She is. But following my initial discussion with Krile, I made inquiries of my own, and as far as I am able to tell, Hydaelyn has not made Her will known to anyone.

 C>> Indeed. And while she and Hydaelyn were inextricably linked, Minfilia yet acted of her own volition. A messenger, yes, but one who spoke with her own voice.

 C>> We too would see your kin liberated, but ere we attempt their rescue, we must first find a means to negate the risk of tempering. Without that, we will be unable even to approach the towers, let alone contend with their defenders.

 C>> As I thought... The aetherial currents have been disturbed here, too.

 C>> Excellent. 'Tis nice to have a smooth beginning to one's journey, at the very least.

 C>> Upon arrival, we will be disembarking into the heart of Sharlayan proper.

 C>> There is no greater concentration of wisdom in all the world. I am confident that, somewhere within that center of knowledge and learning, we will find the answers we seek.

 C>> Hopefully they find no cause to deny us.

 C>> 'Tis true that, as a nation, Sharlayan only forms trade agreements with a select few neutral countries.

 C>> But from a practical standpoint, an island cannot afford to be overly strict with its borders. Especially not if that island's people are wholly devoted to the accumulation of knowledge.

 C>> If one submits the proper paperwork, with satisfactory evidence of identity and intent, then foreigners may be granted entry.

 C>> Quite. So let us be absolutely clear on these points before we proceed.

 C>> The immigration officer will ask for your affiliation and your purpose of visit. Considering Sharlayan's views on intervention, I strongly suggest we avoid any mention of the Scions.

 C>> Krile has laid the groundwork for us to act as associates of the Students of Baldesion, and our ostensible reason for being here is to aid in their order's restoration.

 C>> G'raha Tia, it might expedite our progress should an actual Student be seen at the head of our little group. Would you mind leading the way?

 C>> Y'shtola Rhul.

 C>> It's fine, Urianger. We're all here now.

 C>> Assuming we divide our forces to pursue both of Krile's lines of inquiry, then having you join the group heading to Thavnair would seem the obvious choice.

 C>> But the investigation in Sharlayan is of vital importance as well. Equal, I think, to the Thavnairian one, given that the fate of the world may hinge on the results of both.

 C>> And thereby gain access to a greater range of reading material. I will help with that.

 C>> The island is volcanic, you see, and once upon a time this great hollow must have been a reservoir for magma.

 C>> It was discovered some four hundred years ago, at which point it was repurposed as a storage facility for scrolls and samples and such. Renovations have continued with nigh on no interruption to this day, with the lower levels still undergoing expansion.

 C>> The restricted section in the lower levels of Labyrinthos. Open only to a select few researchers handpicked by the Forum.

 C>> The projects down there are the subject of rumor and hearsay. Forbidden magicks. Advanced technologies that can never be allowed to fall into outside hands. Even Archons are not privy to the truth.

 C>> Those who are--the researchers involved in this secretive work--are not permitted to walk freely in the city, and are instead required to live in isolated quarters.

 C>> Perhaps you might reward us after a fashion, then? It is imperative that we reach the lower levels.

 C>> And seeing as you are already set to descend with your assigned cargo, mayhap we could accompany you as your...assistants?

 C>> ...Indeed. Pray forget I said anything.

 C>> Have you learned aught of interest?

 C>> A flower that reacts to one's feelings? Strange... I must say, I have never heard of such a thing.

 C>> Erenville receives his orders from the Forum. Would it not follow, then, that the superior to whom he reports is a Forum member--or at least a close associate?

 C>> Ours alone to bear. We won't interfere with Erenville's work, nor will he be implicated as an accomplice.

 C>> If you're not comfortable taking part, I can do this alone.

 C>> It might be best if you came along as well. In fact, we should all...

 C>> Krile?

 C>> I'm glad you agree...

 C>> Obstruction and suppression, apparently.

 C>> What, then, is to be our fate? Will you put us on a ship back to Eorzea?

 C>> Refusing to comply will only make matters worse. Let us instead treat this as an opportunity to open a dialogue with the Forum.

 C>> We would have been detained regardless. This way, at least, we manage to stay together.

 C>> I trust your time within the forbidden archives was well spent?

 C>> A terrible enemy stands poised to lay waste to all we hold dear. In the face of such madness, Eorzea reached out to Sharlayan, a respected ally, in the hopes of forming a united front.

 C>> Was your curt dismissal truly the best you could offer?

 C>>  Or are you so preoccupied with your â€œmomentous duty of an age long pastâ€� that even the end of the world is unworthy of your attention?

 C>> From the mouth of a Forum member within fortuitous earshot.

 C>> From the mouth of a Forum member within fortuitous earshot.

 C>> The very same period when Sharlayan scholars in the hinterlands began a formal study of the aetherial sea!

 C>> You found something, did you not? And whatever it was gave rise to your oh-so-important duty...

 C>> Do as you must then. But we Scions will fight--until the heavens fall, until our last breath.

 C>> I agree. While I still have questions concerning the Forum and their grand undertaking, we have all but exhausted our avenues of investigation.

 C>> Simply pressing them any harder on the subject will almost certainly result in our expulsion. Therefore I suggest we explore the aetherial sea connection by way of a letter to Master Matoya, then make our way to Thavnair.

 C>> What does it tell us that the spires even have such defenses?

 C>> Simply pulling a prisoner from the wall is fatal, thus the direct approach is doomed to failure from the outset. Any further measures to dissuade such actions seem...unnecessary.

 C>> Unless, of course, there *is* a way to free the prisoners without killing them. Then it stands to reason that any intruders would be met with overwhelming force.

 C>> So we can hope. And I would prefer to enter the tower with a working theory than with no plan at all.

 C>> I see it. Aether siphoned from the land runs up through the spire, flowing to a single point...

 C>> This is the core we seek.

 C>> Yet something is...off. As large as this structure is, it siphons far more aether than is required to sustain it.

 C>> 'Tis as if the core is feeding on the energy. Consuming it. I need to take a closer look...

 C>> ...Curious. There is something there, embedded inside the core.

 C>> A man's limb...

 C>> Yes. If you would be so kind?

 C>> The floor beneath our very feet dissolves. Brace yourselves!

 C>> We'll send at once to Eorzea for more porxies, and call on the local mages to lend a hand.

 C>> 'Twould seem we share the same desire for peace, great Vrtra. To that end, I wonder if we might trouble you with another question.

 C>> The Telophoroi are intent on recreating the Final Days, an apocalyptic event which we know to predate the sundering of the star.

 C>> As the longest lived among us, know you aught of this terrible cataclysm?

 C>> I see... So again, 'tis the inscrutable Hydaelyn to whom we must look for answers.

 C>> Thank you, Vrtra. You've given us warm reassurance in a world gripped by cold uncertainty.

 C>> Yes, and I made a quick count: there are far more than we could have hoped for.

 C>> Enough to outfit an entire company of soldiers, in fact. Considering the involved process, that they were able to manufacture so many in such a short span of time is nothing short of a miracle.

 C>> Or, we could use them to invade Garlemald proper, and strike directly at the Telophoroi's base of operations...

 C>> Of course, we would need to consult with various Alliance leaders before such a drastic measure could even be contemplated.

 C>> To which end I could set out forthwith and present the idea to each of our allies in person.

 C>> We shall share the burden, then.

 C>> Meanwhile, I think it best that you and the others take the talismans back to the Baldesion Annex. We must keep them safe and secure until we've decided upon a course of action.

 C>> I really must hear more about this theory! Our disciplines are based entirely upon the idea that aether is the fundamental form of all energy.

 C>> As you can imagine, our traveling companions were eager to become acquainted. 'Tis a rare thing indeed to see such a diverse and talented group of individuals assembled for a single purpose.

 C>> We fight not only for the sake of Eorzea, but for the entire world--including the people of Garlemald. Much rides on the efforts of the Ilsabard contingent.

 C>> It's been some time since I last saw you in your element on the battlefield.

 C>> â€œRemove from the fieldâ€� was not a euphemism for â€œenthusiastically murder.â€�

 C>> Well, this is the path our young charges would have us walk--and that we all agreed to follow. You knew it would be hard, yet still you pledged your lance, did you not?

 C>> But before we proceed further, we must learn what has befallen this city, for therein lies the key to understanding and combating the Telophoroi's designs.

 C>> A promising idea. I will assist the healers in their ministrations.

 C>> Of course, I will require a porxie of my own, assuming you can spare one.

 C>> No, no, I am sure we will manage. Better that you take my place in the field. The noxious aether of this place disagrees with me, and as I shall need to draw on my own for the treatment, 'twould be prudent for me to remain within the camp.

 C>> As you may have already heard, we have succeeded in curing the members of the Populares Maxima identified.

 C>> They have provided us with some intriguing insights into the current state of Garlemald.

 C>> The assassination of Emperor Varis was the catalyst for the civil war. Nerva declared his claim to the throne, and his opponents refused to recognize it.

 C>> Fighting broke out in the capital, where Nerva's IIIrd Legion clashed with the Ist, who remained loyal to Varis even after his death.

 C>> Again, Elidibus. Like as not, he had a hand in it. No evidence was found to implicate Varis, certainly.

 C>> Nevertheless, Titus, Nerva, and the IIIrd Legion would have judged it a brazen attempt by the Emperor to rid himself of his political enemies.

 C>> And then, in the midst of this growing turmoil, Varis zos Galvus is murdered...

 C>> And Garlemald's own prodigal son, Gaius van Baelsar, is named the murderer.

 C>> Shortly thereafter, Nerva claims the right of succession, and in response, the Ist Legion claims the assassination was part of a coup d'Ã©tat orchestrated by Titus and Nerva.

 C>> We are of one mind, then.

 C>> I see it... While it is likely more by coincidence than design, these devices might also ward against a primal's influence.

 C>> A picture is beginning to form. If the tremor felt throughout Garlemald was a wave of aether emitted by a primal...

 C>> ...Then while those within range would have been tempered, those huddled around a radio--desperate for news concerning the civil war--would have been spared.

 C>> I don't much like the sound of that, but if we do accept his proposal, I suggest the two of us and...

 C>> May I ask why?

 C>> It is a miracle we were able to restrain the tempered without suffering casualties.

 C>> That's <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>? Over there?

 C>> I am. Perhaps, in the aftermath of the wave, there is some residual effect interfering with my faculties, but...

 C>> Given recent events, I would be surprised if you weren't feeling a bit poorly.

 C>> A hearty meal and a long rest would be my recommendation under normal circumstances, but these are anything but. If Fandaniel's boasts are to be believed, we must act quickly.

 C>> Once you've blown away the cobwebs, we can discuss preparations for our assault on the Tower of Babil.

 C>> It is we who should thank you. The records stored here are nothing short of extraordinary.

 C>> There is much we could learn of Zodiark and His imprisonment, but perhaps you could offer us more focused guidance. Pray tell us of the calamity that came before and comes now again.

 C>> Were the ancients ever able to deduce its source?

 C>> Celestial currents... I cannot say I am familiar with the concept.

 C>> The Ascians set in motion seven Rejoinings before we came to oppose them. How many more worlds would have been lost had we not placed our faith in Her?

 C>> How many more souls living in the present would have been snuffed out for the sake of those long dead?

 C>> Yes, but what is it?

 C>> ...And this moon will serve as the vessel to deliver us to a new home.

 C>> Impressive technology. I daresay it is beyond anything we have ever seen.

 C>> While Amaurotines were a great deal taller, in the present day, persons of such prodigious size are exceedingly rare.

 C>> Think nothing of it--we haven't been the most gracious of guests. Do convey our apologies to Growingway and the others.

 C>> Agreed. The Sharlayan Forum, yes?

 C>> The more I heard, the more obvious it became. The Forum's aims align closely with those of your anonymous patrons. â€œA telling coincidenceâ€� would be an understatement.

 C>> Though had we not taken it upon ourselves to peruse certain restricted tomes in Labyrinthos, we might still be unaware of their plans.

 C>> ...But let us continue this discussion upon our return. I daresay we have kept Alphinaud and the others waiting long enough.

 C>> Were he not so consumed with self-righteousness, he might tell you how proud he is of you both.

 C>> You're still awake. Good.

 C>> Might I trouble you to stand still for a moment?

 C>> Hmmm. Nothing appears out of the ordinary.

 C>> A precautionary measure. You will recall that serving as a vessel for abundant Light in the First very nearly ended poorly.

 C>> In your recent battle on the moon, you were almost certainly exposed to similar, if not greater forces. Fortunately, from what I can see, you and your aether are none the worse for wear.

 C>> Would that Ryne were here to confirm my assessment...

 C>> To think you actually found yourself in a direct confrontation with Zodiark...

 C>> As if Zenos gallivanting about in your body was not misfortune enough. Did you so grossly offend every single deity in a past life that they saw fit to place a curse upon your soul?

 C>> Forgive me, that was in poor taste. I recall vividly how battered and broken it was in the depths of Amaurot.

 C>> Would that you could have seen it with your own eyes. Mayhap then you would understand why the greater part of me is glad you did not. It was...a horror beyond description.

 C>> Promise me you will be careful. That you will seek my counsel if you feel unwell.

 C>> That puts my heart at ease, if only a touch. I suspect it will grow colder as the night wears on, so do be sure to stay warm.

 C>> Sleep well, and may the shadows keep you.

 C>> As I feared...

 C>> The beast was there...and now it is no more, yes?

 C>> I saw nothing. Not the blasphemy that perished here, nor the other men-turned-beasts. And because of this, I now see all too well...

 C>> There is no aether. Where the creatures should be, I saw naught but emptiness...

 C>> Recall the words of the watcher. 'Twas a stagnancy of aether--a cessation of flow leading to decay and absence--that led the ancients to conclude their star was dying...

 C>> This is the same phenomenon. The instant these people are seized by the transformation, their aether begins to...rot and crumble away like dried mud...

 C>> Until, from their corporeal forms to their very souls, naught remains...

 C>> ...Mayhap so. But even if the process was incomplete, 'twas little more than a faint residue.

 C>> Not by any means known to me.

 C>> ...Or by any means at all, like as not. For there is naught left to save.

 C>> There you are. You've spoken with the survivors?

 C>> Then we should take a moment to compare notes. Shall we begin with the two of you?

 C>> If so, then it is not unlike the calamity that befell the ancients.

 C>> With their creation magicks they unwittingly gave form to untold horrors.

 C>> Had they simply lost control, surely it would have manifested in many forms--not all of them monstrous.

 C>> Yet somehow this phenomenon is triggered solely by the darkness in their hearts. A common thread with what we now witness.

 C>> Get away from her. Now!

 C>> We'll handle this. See the townspeople to safety!

 C>> Akasa... Yes, I remember. The unseen gift bestowed from on high...

 C>> An energy influenced solely by emotion!

 C>> Formulating a new theory, as you have, is itself no small feat. I wish you well in your endeavors, and pray you take care.

 C>> So blasphemies now plague all the realm...

 C>> If there is an answer, Hydaelyn Herself will have it. 'Twas She who bound Zodiark and forestalled the Final Days.

 C>> Alas, we have heard naught from Her since the Tower of Babil. Whether She cannot or will not speak, I can only speculate...

 C>> Even the flower She gave us is no more...

 C>> So advised the watcher...but what could be the significance of that name? It is entirely unfamiliar to me.

 C>> Most surely. Yet I do not recall a single mention of it in the records of Anyder.

 C>> Indeed. To the last, let us all do what we can.

 C>> I will consult with Master Matoya and see if she knows of a way to reach Hydaelyn from the aetherial sea.

 C>> An ambitious plan. You have accounted for the safety of all nations and tribes, then?

 C>> And how, pray tell, do you decide who to leave behind?

 C>> 'Twas simple enough to deduce. You have a concord, and so you would never have abandoned the Antitower had you no other means of communication.

 C>> One far more convenient, I suspect.

 C>> You know of it?

 C>> Are you aware of any other sources of refined adamantite?

 C>> All set, I take it?

 C>> The three of you seem to be forgetting who we're up against... It's not every day we battle a divine being of untold power. Well, not quite every day.

 C>> Do try not to get underfoot. Needless to say, there'll be no margin for error.

 C>> There is one thing I must ask.

 C>> By sundering the world into fourteen shards, the aether of all living beings too was divided. This reduction would in theory allow us to more easily interact with dynamis.

 C>> Having seen mankind brought to the very precipice of extinction, you wished for us to develop a means to overcome despair.

 C>> You believed we had the potential, and sundered all creation to see it fulfilled. To deliver us to that swirling maelstrom of dynamis in which our foe hides, and grant us the power to defeat her once and for all. Is this not true?

 C>> Your business with Tataru is finished?

 C>> My, what a thoughtful surprise. Whatever would we do without her?

 C>> It feels like a lifetime ago that Master Louisoix gathered us together to form the Circle of Knowing.

 C>> Since then, we have experienced much. But rather than feeling wiser, the more I learn, the more I find my knowledge lacking.

 C>> What will we learn at the edge of the universe, I wonder...

 C>> [AMUSED LAUGH] Report if displayed.

 C>> We've come far together, and if we have aught to say about it, we'll go further still. Aye, we will avert this calamity and return home.

 C>> In preparation for which, we must give thought to what we hope to achieve after the proverbial dust has settled.

 C>> Indeed... Though it was many years in the making, we have successfully set in motion the gears of fundamental change.

 C>> With this, we have fulfilled our humble role as a symbol of hope...and I daresay it is time to bow out.

 C>> After all, there is no shortage of hands to bear the torch in our stead.

 C>> Why, continue my quest for knowledge, naturally. To begin with, I wish to know the state of the reflections, to which end I must find a means to travel between worlds.

 C>> 'Tis the least I must do if I am to keep my promise.

 C>> Should my pursuits prove unduly arduous, I won't hesitate to call on you.

 C>> And in return, I will take you to see Ryne one day. I'm sure you cannot wait to see the fine young woman she has become.

 C>> To the future of the star.

 C>> How often have we thus assembled...

 C>> To combine our knowledge and seek solutions to the problems before us.

 C>> We are.

 C>> I see... By combining the Loporrits' magicks and the tribes' faith, we convert the Mothercrystal into primals of purer form and greater obedience.

 C>> Summoning as it was intended, one might say.

 C>> So in conclusion, we'll only know what's there when we get there.

 C>> Just to be clear, we're not here to argue with you.

 C>> We know that life is fleeting. And that in the short time we have it, we're not assured happiness.

 C>> Meteion is gone as well. Mayhap he awakened first and gave chase.

 C>> Well then, let us search for Thancred while exploring the area.

 C>> The ship, we leave in your care.

 C>> Agreed. We cannot turn tail here. Not without something to show for our comrade's sacrifice.

 C>> Please, continue. Tell us about this truth you discovered.

 C>> You are entirely too kind. I pray you recount your tale as you see fit.

 C>>  

 C>> So that's your story.

 C>> While I appreciate your advice, I will not heed it.

 C>> Convinced though you may be of this truth, it is yours and not mine. Indeed truth, I have ever believed, is in the eye of the beholder.

 C>> Hardly. As you yourself said, the subject matter is beyond my comprehension.

 C>> And that, I accept, is true. I do not possess the knowledge to prove or disprove your conclusion.

 C>> In my mortal years, I doubt I could even approach the wisdom of the Ea.

 C>> But of one thing am I absolutely certain: I would *not* be happier in ignorance.

 C>> The most important lesson I've learned...is that learning isn't simply passing one's eyes over words.

 C>> Nay... 'Tis when understood for oneself that knowledge attains its true value.

 C>> This is what has sustained me. Driven me onward in joy and wonder. In anger and sorrow.

 C>> The universe may end, and all may be for naught. But I will live as I always have.

 C>> I will always seek out new knowledge. And no conclusion of yours, no matter how grim, can dampen my desire.

 C>> Keep calm, and listen well.

 C>> Though my body will soon dissipate, there may be a way to restore it.

 C>> Azem's magick. So long as our souls remain, you can use it to summon us back.

 C>> But you mustn't, for it would mean losing our way forward. This, I only reveal so that you can promise not to invoke the magick.

 C>> We came here knowing what victory may cost, so press on. Press on, and do not look back.

 C>> Urianger... 

 C>> With you to urge us on, how could we possibly fail?

 C>> Azem's magick. So long as our souls remain, you can use it to summon us back. But you mustn't.

 C>> Honestly... This is far more than any of us could have hoped for. Let us be thankful.

 C>>  

 C>> Someone...hand...

 C>> A fine show indeed...

 C>> What were you thinking, fighting alone? Never do that again. My poor heart couldn't bear it.

 C>> So it must be if we're to keep up appearances.

 C>> From now on, it falls to the Grand Company of Eorzea and its allies to deal with the realm's crises.

 C>> Dravania. There is a book I have been meaning to borrow from the Great Gubal Library.

 C>> And I can think of at least one person who will be most displeased should I fail to visit before leaving.

 C>> Perhaps. But I believe one of our number--a rather important one, at that--has yet to divulge [his/her] plans.

 C>> Mmm... I close my eyes for one moment...

 C>> Ow!

 C>> How long have you two been here?

 C>> 

 C>> Did you now?

 C>> Nor did I want to fall asleep.

 C>> ...Something to that effect.

 C>> I must have been studying for two...three days straight before exhaustion finally claimed me.

 C>> As you know, I've been researching ways to travel from the Source to one of its reflections.

 C>> Well...looking for hints, at least. I don't expect to find a simple set of instructions tucked away in some dark corner of the library.

 C>> So I've been skimming through the stacks, hoping to uncover even a partial mention of any similar feats in the past.

 C>> A means to travel between worlds exists, and you can be sure I will find a way to employ it...

 C>> So I promised Runar, but 'twould seem I've set myself a nigh-impossible task.

 C>> Oh, you think me discouraged? I assure you, 'tis quite the opposite.

 C>> A daunting challenge and the time to sink my teeth into it? I feel like a fresh-faced student again.

 C>> Indeed. Was there something else you wished to ask of me?

 C>> Alzadaal is no minor figure in Hannish history, and much is known about his family.

 C>> But this is the first I've heard of a descendant surviving a trip to another world.

 C>> If those tales are true, then he may have left behind some clue as to how it was accomplished.

 C>> An invitation to delve into one of the world's lingering mysteries? As if I could refuse.

 C>> And whence do we embark upon this expedition?

 C>> Then by all means, let us recruit him and be on our way.

 C>> You've been keeping yourself busy, I trust?

 C>> Aye, though I cherish the Scions' accomplishments, 'tis pleasant to not have the weight of the world upon our shoulders for a change.

 C>> I agree. Between us, we should have the skills to handle whatever situation may arise. Shall we be on our way?

 C>> Feeling left out? I could put in a good word for you, if you like.

 C>> Well, there is one way we might find out...

 C>> You and I will speak later.

 C>> I must admit, I am deathly curious to know how a voidgate came to be hidden in the depths of these ruins.

 C>> Yet you have the beginnings of a gate right here, under the control of a Hannish device.

 C>> Right--here we all are.

 C>> I took a closer look at that device. I was able to determine how it keeps the voidgate sealed, but not how it might instead be employed to expand the opening.

 C>> For that, I would need to reference the technique developed by Vrtra's alchemists--no records of which appear to have survived the intervening years.

 C>> Patience, good ser--one must introduce the subject before launching into specifics.

 C>> From what we understand, travel between worlds is accomplished by passing through the nebulous rift which exists between them.

 C>> Picture, if you will, the moment you were called to the First.

 C>> You touched a focus of some kind to help the Exarch pinpoint your location. His summoning spell then channeled the energies of the Crystal Tower to begin your journey to his world.

 C>> The magicks tore a hole in the wall separating Source and shard, and cast you into the intervening nothingness.

 C>> In that place, the laws of nature hold no sway...

 C>> Yet even through this realm of temporal and spatial instability, you were borne safely to your destination in the First.

 C>> The feat that guided you across such an unimaginable distance--both physical and metaphorical--was nothing short of a miracle.

 C>> An excellent question.

 C>> Though there are several methods by which the void's denizens might intrude upon our world, the rituals of summoning are the most typical.

 C>> For example, let us consider the gargoyle--a creature of middling power.

 C>> To call upon such an entity, the prospective summoner must force open a voidgate.

 C>> The portal lasts but a moment and is relatively small, allowing only an imp or other lesser being to squeeze through with their physical body intact.

 C>> Our more powerful gargoyle, however, is too large for that. Creating a gate big enough for him would require vast amounts of energy--far beyond the reserves of any one mortal practitioner.

 C>> Instead, 'tis far more common to bring over only the entity's soul. We had a taste of that ourselves when a certain Exarch dragged us to the First.

 C>> And just as our bodies remained in our world, the voidsent's physical form is left behind in the Thirteenth.

 C>> Once at its destination, the summoned soul is granted a temporary shell to inhabit. In the gargoyle's case, a stone effigy has proven a suitable vessel.

 C>> Exactly. For a being to navigate the chaos of the rift, with or without form, there must needs be a guiding agent on the other side.

 C>> I believe solving that mystery is key to understanding travel between the Source and its reflections.

 C>> Perhaps. But what some call â€œdanger,â€� others think of as â€œadventure.â€�

 C>> I assure you I was most attentive. And I agree that to go alone would be certain death.

 C>> But if I were to bring along one who has already braved the Thirteenth and humbled the Cloud of Darkness--well, I imagine my chances would be much improved.

 C>> I had a feeling you might say that.

 C>> Once again, I put my life in your ever-reliable hands.

 C>> Since when were you one for the quiet life?

 C>> Once again, I put my life in your ever-reliable hands.

 C>> That said, as much as I would like to march straight back to the voidgate, there is the small matter of being unable to open it without the satrap's personal authority...

 C>> You have my word that we will take every precaution--not a single voidsent will be allowed to threaten Radz-at-Han. Assuming we manage to expand the portal in the first place...

 C>> Actually, I had hoped you might help us with that. I presume the alchemists you retained supplied you with some explanation of their methodology?

 C>> Daemir, Daemir... Ah, yes, the family associated with the Great Work.

 C>> ...A man-made voidsent?

 C>> If that's true, then those notes might still be stored in a forbidden archive somewhere. Not Gubal, of course, since that library had yet to be built. Which leaves us with...

 C>> Yes, it may very well hold a copy.

 C>> Indeed. Noumenon's restricted stacks may very well hold a copy.

 C>> Have you already forgotten G'raha's debacle in Noumenon?

 C>> ...The restricted section where he was caught sneaking about? It may very well hold a copy of the Daemirs' documentation.

 C>> In which case, I say we head directly to Sharlayan.

 C>> Let us be on our way, as well.

 C>> If House Daemir's notes are to be found anywhere, it will be here. Let us begin.

 C>> Yes, the aether signature is unmistakable. I've felt the traces of House Daemir's resonance many times at the Great Work.

 C>> Time to see what all the fuss was about...

 C>> â€œAmong the ranks of the voidsent, there exist entities with the power to call forth their brethren from beyond. The species known as â€�Atomos,â€œ however, is uniquely prodigious in this regard.

 C>> â€œFrom its distended maw, it can expel an endless procession of voidborn creatures--a talent which sorely tested the Radiant Host in its battles against these abominations.

 C>> â€œSurmising that the entity itself was acting as a voidgate, we endeavored to capture a small specimen and subsequently examine its physiological structure.

 C>> â€œOur findings revealed that the Atomos had absorbed a planar fissure into its own flesh, which it could expand at will into a functioning gate.

 C>> â€œUpon further analysis, we identified an aetherial wave pattern emitted during this process--a pattern we were able to emulate by passing crystal-stored aether through a specially designed prism.

 C>> â€œWe proceeded to embed said prism into an arcane simulacrum, thus completing what we have dubbed our 'artificial Atomos.'â€�

 C>> How could I have been so blind to the possibilities? This species, not to mention its ability to summon voidsent, has been discussed among academics for years now.

 C>> Just before the advent of the Seventh Umbral Calamity, we received reports of Atomos sightings from every corner of Eorzea. Surely you witnessed an appearance yourself in the course of your travels?

 C>> Just before the advent of the Seventh Umbral Calamity, we received reports of Atomos sightings from every corner of Eorzea. Surely you've at least heard the tales?

 C>> And still House Daemir went and built a mock Atomos of their very own. I'm not surprised the Archons consigned their work to a restricted archive.

 C>> 'Twas no easy task, but at last we've unearthed the volume we've been searching for.

 C>> I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted to stay longer. See what other forbidden titles might be lurking on these shelves...

 C>> Ah, but that would be abusing the very special privilege we've been granted now, wouldn't it? Better not.

 C>> There is something I wish to verify.

 C>> The NOAH reports claim that a short stint into the void carries little risk of aetheric imbalance.

 C>> Should one suffer an injury, however, or if one's expedition drags on longer than intended, that risk becomes significantly greater.

 C>> G'raha theorized that a warding scale would confer protection from the void's corrupting influence... But I would prefer to test that hypothesis before we set foot in the Thirteenth ourselves.

 C>> Yes. An experiment... Tell me: how would *you* go about testing the efficacy of the warding scale?

 C>> Estinien is correct. Which is why I've elected to send a familiar in our stead.

 C>> We needn't attempt anything so drastic. A small familiar should serve well enough.

 C>> Very good. I see you've been paying attention.

 C>> As Vrtra sent his simulacrum, so too shall we rely on a familiar to bear the brunt of any unpleasant consequences.

 C>> Now, a lowly imp can navigate a fissure, no matter how narrow.

 C>> Which means an arcane entity of similar stature should be able to manage the same.

 C>> I hadn't wanted it to come to this...but no other familiars will do, I'm afraid.

 C>> From ocean rise and cloudbank form,
From mountain spring and rainfall storm,
From river flow and life be born...

 C>> Water, water, froth and foam!â™ª

 C>> Though not my first choice, these familiars I conceived of as a child have the best chance of fitting through the gate.

 C>> ...I only wish my younger self had considered a more dignified ending to the creation ritual.

 C>> In any case, these two should serve us well.

 C>> This one will bear a warding scale...

 C>> And when they return from the Thirteenth, we can observe how the talisman--or absence thereof--has affected the progress of the void's corruption.

 C>> If I could impose upon you to open the gate, Your Excellency?

 C>> We should also be wary of voidsent slipping through while we conduct our experiment. Estinien, you are to keep Nidhana safe from harm.

 C>> You had best be on your guard, as well.

 C>> And we are glad for it.

 C>> Oh? Are you volunteering to join the nixies? I could shrink you down, you know...

 C>> Please, just...do me a favor, and forget you ever saw that.

 C>> Let us begin, shall we?

 C>> Nixies! Into the void!

 C>> I think we've waited long enough.

 C>> Nixies! Return to my side!

 C>> Thank you, little one. You did well.

 C>> The unprotected nixie has suffered extensive aetheric corruption. As Nidhana observed, it's well on its way to becoming a voidsent.

 C>> The one merged with the talisman, however, appears unaffected. I sense no changes to its equilibrium.

 C>> Rest now, little ones.

 C>> So it would seem. But while our second familiar was untouched by void energies, the talisman itself shows signs of degradation.

 C>> It was, of course, originally designed to shield the soul from primal tempering--it stands to reason that aetheric corruption of a different sort would affect it differently.

 C>> We may need to modify the warding scale's design to account for the Thirteenth's uniquely unstable aether...

 C>> Ah, my apologies. I forget that not all of us spend our days sequestered in dusty archives.

 C>> The Thirteenth is a reflection of the Source that was drowned in a flood of Darkness.

 C>> In Emet-Selch's own words, this tragedy was a result of the Ascians' attempts to force a Rejoining. They erred in their haste, and made of that world a â€œuseless void.â€�

 C>> You remember Unukalhai, the unusual child we met during our troubles with the Warring Triad? He explained the fate of the Thirteenth thus:

 C>> The champions of that ill-fated world used the stone known as â€œauraciteâ€� to contain the power of primals.

 C>> But those selfsame heroes were gradually corrupted by the auracite's bleeding energies, transforming into fiends with an endless hunger for aether.

 C>> By the time anyone thought to oppose them, Light's strength had grown too feeble...and the balance of the Thirteenth tipped into eternal Darkness.

 C>> It was Elidibus, as I recall, who rescued Unukalhai's spirit from his final battlefield.

 C>> But I wonder if there were others whom the Emissary saved from oblivion...

 C>> The server...Cyella, wasn't it? And you say she was another of Elidibus's pawns?

 C>> Cylva? The adventurer who traveled with the Warriors of Light? And you say she was another of Elidibus's pawns?

 C>> I see... So Cyella, or rather, Cylva, was beguiled by the same dreams of heroism as Unukalhai.

 C>> And what of your own experience? Will you tell us of what you observed during NOAH's expedition?

 C>> I can picture it now... The sunless, stygian expanse, infested with legions of aether-starved monstrosities. A void in every sense of the word.

 C>> Worry not, great Vrtra--our journey into the Thirteenth is but the first leg of a longer voyage.

 C>> A voyage that shall lead us to other reflections--to new mysteries and discoveries--and I mean to be there every step of the way.

 C>> But first I must focus on refining the warding talisman...

 C>> 'Tis a lengthy process, but the end is in sight, yes.

 C>> The usual reaction to someone forcing open a voidgate is to run for the hills... Hannish academics certainly are a different breed.

 C>> And were you not also fearless--heedless, even--in your determination?

 C>> I have something for you as well.

 C>> While you were gone, Urianger paid us a visit.

 C>> As you may recall, he joined us on our foray into Alzadaal's Legacy in part to conduct research for the Loporrits.

 C>> Research they were delighted to receive, and which has already inspired them to consider new ways to improve their own treasure vault.

 C>> As a token of their gratitude, Livingway entrusted a familiar relic to Urianger...

 C>> Aye, the crystal which showed the way to Meteion. 

 C>> The Loporrits no longer have need of it, and thus saw fit to return it to us.

 C>> Harboring the power of Light, it could well aid us in our mission in the void.

 C>> And who better to bear Hydaelyn's gift than Her chosen champion?

 C>> Go! Absorb the voidgate!

 C>> It worked. We should have no trouble passing through a gate of that size.

 C>> Should we require healing, I can provide it. 'Twould be a welcome change of pace from my recent havoc wreaking.

 C>> And not for the first time. He and his brethren must keep watch over the portal.

 C>> I expect some voidsent are more intelligent than others. Perhaps these ones simply do not understand our words.

 C>> I see it now. The bottomless darkness. The insatiable hunger. The aura was present when we faced him in Garlemald.

 C>> When Zenos died, its connection to the Source was severed. It was forced to return to the void.

 C>> I see it now. The bottomless darkness. The insatiable hunger. The aura was present when we faced him in Garlemald.

 C>> When Zenos died, its connection to the Source was severed. It was forced to return to the void.

 C>> Is that...Hydaelyn's crystal!?

 C>> â€œAvatarâ€� as in the voidsent servants of reapers.

 C>> â€œAvatarâ€� as in the voidsent servants of reapers.

 C>> In the name of his hunt, Zenos took up that traditional Garlean art.

 C>> And through it, he forged a covenant with a being of the void to lend him strength.

 C>> As Light begat sin eaters, Darkness begat voidsent.

 C>> If I may... The Darkness in you is too much for any man to harbor; to my eyes, you are indeed a voidsent.

 C>> Yet your knowledge of the past and your demeanor mark you apart from your brethren.

 C>> You are different, that much is plain. But in what way, I am unsure.

 C>> Forgive me, 'twas not my intent to pry...

 C>> I realize, too, that I've neglected to ask your name.

 C>> How about...â€œZeroâ€�?

 C>> No, not â€œnothing,â€� but rather a â€œbeginning.â€� For it remains to be seen what you will become to us.

 C>> I thought I heard a voice as well. The keening of voidsent, perhaps...

 C>> Very well.

 C>> Death doesn't exist...?

 C>> Report if displayed.

 C>> Of course. In the First, the power of Light--of passivity--prevents life from emerging in the Empty.

 C>> But in the Thirteenth, the power of Darkness--of activity--prevents life from finding rest, even should soul be separated from flesh.

 C>> If you could lend us a hand, we'd be much obliged.

 C>> You never know until you try, and I'm always happy to experiment.

 C>> You know, Zero. You do owe us for one thing.

 C>> Your name.

 C>> You'll have your promised aether, but we are owed compensation for your name.

 C>> They've been crystallized!

 C>> Completely.

 C>> The voidsent's essence remains.

 C>> But it has been sealed away--transformed into crystal.

 C>> Yes, yes. I still have work to do, so I would thank you not to get carried away.

 C>> Report if displayed.

 C>> That makes us even, I trust.

 C>> Right, then--when you picked up the crystal, you experienced a vision, did you not?

 C>> We've been given much to consider. Let us a take a moment to review what we know.

 C>> A settlement of pariahs...

 C>> They must have been tracking our movements.

 C>> Aye! See to Barbariccia!

 C>> I see you've bested Barbariccia. Well done.

 C>> Her aether is nearly spent. Perhaps unsurprising given how much power she used.

 C>> In the wastelands of the Thirteenth, one can only replenish aether by taking it from others, be it by trade or by force.

 C>> In contrast, the Source is rich in ambient aether.

 C>> Simply being here and drawing breath, Zero will absorb what she needs.

 C>> I believe so.

 C>> She will awaken in time, and when she does, give her something to eat. Judging by her form, she should also be able to derive nourishment from food.

 C>> I know you promised her your aether, but perhaps she might appreciate fine Hannish cuisine more.

 C>> Zero said before that Zenos had altered her essence.

 C>> A change wrought, I suspect, with the power of Darkness. It acted upon the part of her that is voidsent, rendering it dominant. Thus we were able to reverse it with the power of Light.

 C>> I labor to believe that Zenos possessed such arcane knowledge. In all likelihood, it came from Fandaniel.

 C>> Were Zero wholly voidsent, I doubt the crystal would have had an effect on her.

 C>> One might say that Hydaelyn had a hand in your meeting.

 C>> The long years without eating may have dulled your sense of taste.

 C>> Though if our recent experience has taught us anything, 'tis that the Thirteenth is more dangerous than we ever imagined. Caution must be our watchword.

 C>> The Ascians. And these eidolons are surely primals.

 C>> And so you were born part voidsent. Before the world was overcome?

 C>> The Flood of Darkness...

 C>> A lost world, you say?

 C>> I wouldn't be so sure. The Thirteenth is still there, is it not?

 C>> To explain requires that we initiate you into the truth of the Source and its reflections. Be warned that this will take a while...

 C>> The Oracle of Light prevented the First from being completely overcome, so the situation may not be completely identical to that of your Thirteenth.

 C>> But the fact remains that we were able to restore a measure of balance to a world brought to the brink of destruction.

 C>> After which, some intrepid young souls succeeded in restoring life back to lands thought lost to Light.

 C>> Which gives me cause to hope the day may yet come when life springs forth anew in the Thirteenth.

 C>> Which gives me cause to hope there may be a way to restore Light and life to the Thirteenth.

 C>> Of course, these are only possibilities. I offer no guarantees.

 C>> But having experienced what we have, I daresay we are more qualified than most to speak on the matter.

 Q>> 

 Q>> 

 Q>> Only those with proven expertise receive the mark--as our newcomer has. Pay no heed to her manner.

 Q>> I keep my senses strained for signs of Ascian activity, but there is little news to be had.

 Q>> Have their schemes reached some critical step? This silence is most disturbing...

 Q>> Thancred told me of the explosives. Let us secure the plant, and swiftly, that we might proceed with our original agenda.

 Q>> Now *that* is an impressive piece of steel.

 Q>> Our list of grievances against the Ascians was already overlong. Must they continue to add to it?

 Q>> Our list of grievances against the Ascians was already overlong. Must they continue to add to it?

 Q>> Was there aught we might have done to save her? 'Tis foolish to torture oneself with such thoughts, but the heart is ofttimes deaf to quiet reason.

 Q>> The Rising Stones feels somehow colder. Moenbryda always carried with her such an abundance of warmth and cheer.

 Q>> If I did not know better, I should think our bard had run afoul of another jilted lover...

 Q>> If I did not know better, I should think our bard had run afoul of another jilted lover...

 Q>> <sigh> ...The snake slithered away.

 Q>> I am only glad he did not have the chance to sink his fangs more deeply into you.

 Q>> Those pirates do not belong to any of the known Lominsan factions... Whom then do they serve? The *beast tribes*? Surely not.

 Q>> But the timing of their appearance coincides all too neatly with the recent surge in Sahagin and kobold activity... Something is afoot. The question is: what?

 Q>> ...Could it be that the tribes are planning to summon their primals?

 Q>> Twelve help us if it should prove so. Limsa would be hard-pressed to keep a single primal at bay, let alone two. But all is yet speculation. I must needs find evidence.

 Q>> The seas continue to rise...

 Q>> While the lesser moon continues to fall...

 Q>> And ilm by ilm, the world becomes ever more unlike itself.

 Q>> It is as Louisoix foretold...

 Q>> The coming of chaos has rendered the laws of nature mutable, blurring the boundary between the material and aetherial planes... Little now stands between us and the primals.

 Q>> ...But they are not here yet.
â€œThough time be against us, hope shall ever be on our side.â€�

 Q>> Never did the creed of Sharlayan ring more true.

 Q>> Never did I dream that I would possess the means to *see* aether...yet now that I do, I do begin to take it for granted. How swiftly do the wonders of Sharlayan seem commonplace...

 Q>> Wait. A disturbance in the aetheric flow. But whence does it emanate?

 Q>> ...Seasong Grotto, perhaps?

 Q>> What have we here...? Can you walk?

 Q>> 'Tis I.
Regrettably, no. He eluded me.
Understood. I will inform the commodore.

 Q>> You collapsed from your exertions. Are you suitably recovered?

 Q>> Sevrin here has apprised me of all that transpired. His account shed some light upon how you came to be attacked by a *golem* of all things.

 Q>> A golem is a mindless automaton, inert save when commanded to be otherwise. Common pirates could not hope to control such a thing, so arcane are its workings.

 Q>> But then these tattooed wretches are no common pirates--they are the minions of the Sahagin. As to their purpose...well, I shall get to the bottom of it.

 Q>> But first I must escort Sevrin back to his place of employment. I daresay Staelwyrn will be wondering what has become of him.

 Q>> And you too, for that matter. I will bear word to him of your preservation, but I am certain he would like to thank you in person. Pray pay the man a visit.

 Q>> Ah...he told me of you, but perchance he did not tell you of me. My name is Y'shtola.

 Q>> I am...a naturalist of sorts, surveying the aether in the hope that it might offer up some clue as to our predicament. 

 Q>> For reasons I cannot fathom, you seem...
Forgive me. Mayhap we shall have a chance to speak again when I have marshaled my thoughts.

 Q>> Until our paths next cross, farewell.

 Q>> Greetings.

 Q>> I have been expecting you.

 Q>> Last but not least is Urianger, who presides over all affairs within these halls. Pray seek him out whenever you have questions.

 Q>> At the Battle of Carteneau, our leader was taken from us. But we did not stray from our purpose.

 Q>> We sought out Minfilia and others with her talent, and together established the Scions of the Seventh Dawn.

 Q>> Concerning the kobolds they sent such copious notes on, I presume?

 Q>> What sort of peril?

 Q>> Years before the Grand Company's reformation, two primals, Leviathan and Titan, chanced to converge upon the seawall, wreaking untold devastation.

 Q>> There, by the grace of the Navigator, were the mercenaries Merlwyb hired able to fend them off.

 Q>> Yet it did not take long for the beast tribes to regroup, and they summoned their primals once more.

 Q>> The Maelstrom has kept a watchful eye upon the beast tribes--and the kobolds in particular--ever since.

 Q>> Which brings us to the matter at hand.

 Q>> Expect the worst.

 Q>> The Maelstrom's help is of course appreciated, but even if we had their whole armada at our disposal, we could still find ourselves overmatched.

 Q>> A pity the kobolds lack the gentle sensibilities of the sylphs. A peaceful resolution would be more than welcome.

 Q>> The Echo will not avail you this time, I fear. If you are to survive, your steel must needs speak for you.

 Q>> No one would think you a coward were you to decline.

 Q>> I never thought it in question.

 Q>> Forgive the lack of forewarning, High Commander. The Admiral wished to address [WARRIOR OF LIGHT] personally.

 Q>> I hope you are right. Yet the situation is far from simple. The kobolds are not prone to unprovoked aggression. Did not the thalassocracy make a pact with the beastmen that each would keep to their own lands, and that no blood would be shed?

 Q>> ...And was it not the *Lominsans* who violated this agreement, dissatisfied with their lot? Shall we then condemn the beastmen for defending their homes?

 Q>> Even a pirate must one day reap what she has sown.

 Q>> My apologies, Admiral. The safety and security of Limsa Lominsa's citizenry are, of course, of paramount concern.

 Q>> That the kobolds should summon Titan demonstrates they are no longer amenable to negotiation.

 Q>> This being the case, we must needs prepare for conflict. Before we meet Titan in the field, however, it would be wise to learn all we can of our foe. And I can think of no better source of information than the mercenaries who defeated him once before.

 Q>> Quite why a mercenary should choose to become a miller, I do not know. When you find him, mayhap you could ask him for me. I, meanwhile, shall seek his fellows.

 Q>> Though word will already have reached Maelstrom Command, protocol requires that a representative of our order inform the high commander of the mission's success. The honor is rightfully yours, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT].

 Q>> Once again, I must commend you on a job well done. We shall speak again soon.

 Q>> [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. I see you and Alphinaud are safe. And...and Cid.

 Q>> That we five should meet each other thus defies simple explanation. It is as if the benevolent hand of Master Louisoix guides us still.

 Q>> He would not see us undone so easily. Not now, when the need is so great.

 Q>> I know where Minfilia and the others are being held.

 Q>> An imperial stronghold in the heart of Mor Dhona--Castrum Centri.

 Q>> ...The tribunus herself, just as you said. You have the eye of an ahriman, Yda.

 Q>> With unexpected ease, if truth be told. There chanced to be a commotion outside the castrum's walls which allowed us to avail ourselves of the comforts of your vehicle.

 Q>> That is far from your most pressing concern. First, you must answer for your *own* wrongdoing, Livia sas Junius.

 Q>> 'Twas you who led the raid on the Waking Sands--you who butchered unarmed men and women for the crime of being unworthy of capture.

 Q>> Nor shall we suffer you to plague Eorzea a day longer. Betake you to your guard.

 Q>> Confound it! Yda, with me!

 Q>> Pray forgive us our delay!

 Q>> The reunion must wait!

 Q>> One...

 Q>> We haven't a moment to waste.

 Q>> A mere replica, created using data obtained from anomalous crystals found across Eorzea.

 Q>> Yda is right. We must have faith.

 Q>> It's <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>. I feel [his/her] presence!

 Q>> Thank Hydaelyn...

 Q>> (-???-)*I am the waves that bear.
I am the winds that guide.*

 Q>> (-???-)*I am the evening stars.
I am the morning sky.
I am born of the sea.
And there shall I die.*

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)Thus reads the Sailors' Requiem carved into yonder stone.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)Such words well describe the manner in which the citizens of Limsa Lominsa live their lives.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)It is both a litany against misfortune for those out on the waves...

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)...and a prayer that the souls of those who perish on land might find their way back to the sea.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)We meet again.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)Or do we? My apologies, I fear I have mistaken you for another.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)Something about you... Your gait, perhaps? Well, no matter.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)What brings you to this sacred place of seafarers, if I may ask?

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)Ah, you are the adventurer I've seen around Summerford Farms.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)I thought myself on the trail of the kidnappers, but it would seem I have missed my mark.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)...Or perhaps not.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)As I suspected, the aetheric disturbance here is no natural occurrence.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)Nor is it a coincidence that the two of us should come here in search of those responsible for the disappearances only to be attacked.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)But who stands to benefit from the keeping of this secret?

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)Such thoughts must wait. Let us attend to the task at hand, unpleasant though it be.

 Q>> I sense something awry with this creature. Be on your guard.

 Q>> Ware! The disruption of the aether draws others to the fray!

 Q>> Keep your focus on the battle!
Leave the tending of wounds to me.

 Q>> More unwelcome visitors?
Slay them quickly lest we be overwhelmed.

 Q>> The creature falters.
Press the attack and the battle will soon be won.

 Q>> Mayhap we are overmatched...

 Q>> ...

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)Awake again, are we?

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)Aha. The poor creature's fury was kindled with cruel forethought.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)See this blade? I found it in the goobbue's back.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)I have seen knives of this kind before--they are most commonly used for the cutting of rope.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)It would appear our culprits are seafaring men of some persuasion...piratical being the most probable.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)In any event, you seem much recovered from your sudden...affliction.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)I confess, I was rather taken aback when you collapsed at the very moment of our victory. Mayhap a surfeit of aether...?

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)I beg your pardon? A â€œtowering crystalâ€�? I'm sure I don't-- Oh.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)Well, well... This *has* been a day of unexpected revelations.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)I must continue my investigation.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)In the meantime, I suggest you deliver this knife to your patron, along with a warning concerning the pirates' probable involvement in this murky business.

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)The days ahead promise little rest, I fear...

 Q>> (-Cultured Conjurer-)May our paths cross again under the light of the Crystal.

 Q>> â€œParagons,â€� did he say? Then it is as I feared.

 Q>> They are known as the Bringers of Chaos...or *Ascians*, to give them their proper name.

 Q>> It would seem our suspicions were correct--it is they who have been manipulating the beast tribes.

 Q>> Pardon? You would know if we Sharlayans have encountered Ascians before?
...I have never spoken to you of my homeland. How did you know whence I hail?

 Q>> Wait. I do begin to see. You have been blessed with a special gift.

 Q>> A trifle simplistic, but not inaccurate.

 Q>> I came as soon as I sensed his presence, but I never thought to find such a scene of carnage. Yet we prevailed. And thanks to your heroic actions, I have learned much.

 Q>> I am glad to have played a role in bringing what I hope is an end to this disturbing spate of abductions.

 Q>> The thread of your fate forms a part of a most intriguing tapestry. Mayhap we will be afforded the chance to speak more in the near future.

 Q>> For now, however, you must see this particular tale to its conclusion. Pray send my greetings to Commodore Reyner.

 Q>> A fearsome opponent...against whom you shall not stand alone!

 Q>> His power wanes! Afford him no chance to recover!

 Q>> Such an extraordinary glow...

 Q>> This...is one of the Crystals of Light.

 Q>> After our encounter with the goobbue, you had a vision, did you not? Of a towering crystal?

 Q>> You bathed in Her Light...

 Q>> (-???-)Ever the selfless hero, I see.

 Q>> It has been a while, adventurer.

 Q>> I have been watching you closely ever since you flew out of Limsa Lominsa.

 Q>> You discharged your duty as the Admiral's personal envoy with admirable humility, and you have displayed unfaltering courage in the face of danger ever since.

 Q>> Whensoever you came upon those in need, you gave them succor with no thought of personal gain.

 Q>> In summary, you have demonstrated all of the qualities we seek in an adventurer.

 Q>> For reasons I cannot well explain, your every deed seems invariably to serve the general good...whether you mean it to or not. It is a happy knack, and one which speaks volumes for your character!

 Q>> Yet for all your admirable qualities, it is your *gift* which intrigues me most. I speak of the visions you experience. Visions like the one you had mere moments ago, if I am not mistaken. I can provide you with the means to understand them.

 Q>> An acquaintance of mine is blessed with the selfsame talent, you see... If you so desire, I can introduce you to her. She and I fight for a common cause--a cause which would greatly benefit for your support.

 Q>> If you would agree to lend us your strength, we should be glad to do all within our power to aid you in your personal endeavors.

 Q>> Think on my offer awhile. Should you decide to accept it, pray speak with Momodi. The proprietress of the Quicksand is a close friend and ally of ours.

 Q>> Inform her that you have been chosen by the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, and she will tell you where to find us.

 Q>> â€œFor a timeâ€� bears repeating. We can ill afford to fall complacent.

 Q>> The Maelstrom keeps the kobolds under constant observation.

 Q>> We shall hear from them ere long, you may depend upon it.

 Q>> We *must* slay him, Captain. The people of Limsa Lominsa are depending upon us.

 Q>> Be not so quick to judge. Long have I labored for the well-being of you and yours. And my associate here has bathed in Ifrit's hellfire and lived.

 Q>> <Clickable(<If(PlayerParameter(4))>She<Else/>He</If>)/> is blessed with a power that protects <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> from primal influence. Thus was <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> able to lay low the Lord of the Inferno.

 Q>> We know full well the risks, and have taken every possible precaution. We lack only the knowledge of how to enter Titan's lair. Pray be so good as to grant us the boon of your wisdom, and we shall be on our way.

 Q>> Though our lives be forfeit, we will not abandon Limsa to the wrath of Titan.

 Q>> Ye gods, man--have you heard nothing I have said? We have not the *time* to perform trivial tasks. The enemy is at the gates!

 Q>> <sigh> Though it pains me to admit it, I fear we have no choice but to acquiesce to the man's demands.

 Q>> Yet much remains to be done if we are to best Titan. Forgive me, but I must ask you to undertake this task alone. I will use the time to see to the remaining preparations.

 Q>> Pray do whatever the good captain bids...however trifling. Remember: the fate of Limsa Lominsa hangs in the balance.

 Q>> ...You have the look of a <If(PlayerParameter(4))>woman<Else/>man</If> who has been to the seventh hell and back.

 Q>> That a guest should be expected to supply the victuals for a banquet held in [his/her] own honor... And this while the shadow of Titan looms over us all! It beggars belief.

 Q>> I can only applaud your stoicism. Had I been asked to endure such ignominy, I fear I should have accepted my lot with less grace.

 Q>> Spare <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If> your mockery, Captain. Your intent was unclear to me until this moment. And unlike me, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT] has no knowledge of your traditions. Mayhap you would be so good as to enlighten <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>.

 Q>> Which is why the five of you deigned to test [WARRIOR OF LIGHT] with such *commendable* thoroughness. Time well spent, I am sure. But tell us, Captain: what is the assessment of you and your fellows?

 Q>> ...You are kind to indulge them, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. This banquet is as much for the Company as it is for you, whatever they may claim.

 Q>> I do not deny that they mean well, but now is scarcely the time for celebration. Though they have all but pronounced you the victor, the battle with Titan has yet to begin. The hour has come for the good captain to make good on his promise. We must speak with him again.

 Q>> He speaks of an unamplified aetheryte which has been claimed by a beast tribe. Lest you wonder, there is no fundamental difference between such aetherytes and those which you have used on countless occasions, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT].

 Q>> Forgive me for interrupting. I had planned to await your report, but I succumbed to curiosity.

 Q>> The tunnels beneath O'Ghomoro form a bewildering labyrinth that no outsider has ever fully explored. How the Company of Heroes managed to navigate it is a mystery I have long pondered.

 Q>> Hm. Even if there were aetheryte shards in the depths of O'Ghomoro, you would have needed to attune yourselves to them before you could identify their signatures within the Lifestream.

 Q>> *...Did he now*? Hmph.
Locating a beacon in the absence of a known signature might be possible if the aetherytes in question happened to be... Ah, yes. But in order to guide a traveler to said beacon safely, a second party would be required to... Hmmm.

 Q>> It is possible--in theory at least. Yet I cannot be certain until I try. Plainly, all will depend upon whether or not I am â€œworth my salt.â€�

 Q>> So this is the aetheryte the Company of Heroes used to gain access to Titan's sanctuary.

 Q>> Hm. It is as Papalymo speculated.

 Q>> In its present state, this aetheryte's signal will not be strong enough for our purposes. I may, however, be able to use my own energies to amplify it. Alas, the task will monopolize my attention for the duration.

 Q>> It seems you will have to proceed without me, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. I must needs remain here and supplement this beacon's power, lest you be denied your only path of escape.

 Q>> Fear not: I will summon the Maelstrom forces stationed nearby to protect us.

 Q>> With effort, it is possible that I may be able to stabilize the aetheryte's signal and thereby join you, albeit belatedly. Until such time as I do, you will be on your own.

 Q>> Now...let us see if I *am* worth my salt.

 Q>> I have located another beacon--one far below the mountain. I can only speculate as to what you will find there, so stint not in your preparation.

 Q>> And naught remained to mark his passing...

 Q>> Well, the Ascians are nothing if not elusive. It is of little wonder that they should cast advanced teleportation magicks at will.

 Q>> But that they would choose to consort with the *Empire*...

 Q>> What common goal could they possibly share...? 

 Q>> I feared I might arrive too late, but I see you had the matter well in hand.

 Q>> I have taken measures to ensure that we are not pursued, yet I cannot say how long they will hold.

 Q>> Take your leave while the kobolds are still in disarray. I will follow anon. There is something I must investigate before I depart.

 Q>> I will teleport you to the aetheryte in Zelma's Run, and we will rendezvous at Camp Bronze Lake. Agreed?

 Q>> I am relieved to see you well. But come, let us discuss our next step.

 Q>> I must needs remain here to ensure that you have a means of egress. As I told you, we have no way of knowing what awaits you at the beacon, so be sure to prepare yourself prior to departing.

 Q>> The rescue of our allies will be no small undertaking, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT].

 Q>> Even under normal circumstances, breaching the defenses of an imperial castrum would be a highly dangerous proposition.

 Q>> But now that Castrum Centri houses prisoners whom the Garleans deem valuable, we may be confident that they have taken additional measures to ensure the stronghold's security.

 Q>> If we are to free our friends, we will require an effective strategy. And if we are to formulate an effective strategy, we will require intelligence.

 Q>> I believe I know a man who may be able to assist us in this: Lord Portelaine of House Durendaire. He is stationed at the Observatorium in Coerthas. Let us go to him, and beseech his aid.

 Q>> They hold several of our number--whom we intend to free. Any information you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

 Q>> Incident?

 Q>> If, as has been suggested, the Garleans took our fellow Scions prisoner in hopes of understanding the Echo, it seems reasonable to assume that they will not be executed until such time as the study is complete.

 Q>> But Biggs and Wedge are *not* Scions, nor do they know aught of the Echo. As Lord Portelaine said, this may prove our only chance to rescue them. I say we seize it.

 Q>> Ah, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT], it is well that you are here. The situation is grave.

 Q>> Yda has the right of it. He will perish if we delay.

 Q>> With me!

 Q>> He has been too long in the cold. We must find shelter for him.

 Q>> ...Monument Tower, you say? Very well, Yda and I shall bear him there with all haste.

 Q>> We are a family, are we not?

 Q>> I myself have asked the same question. That day, when I returned to the carnage at the Waking Sands, I noted naught amiss in Horizon--nothing at all to suggest the passing of an imperial force. From this, I conclude that the Garleans came neither by land nor by air. Nay, they were borne there by potent teleportation magicks--magicks of the kind used by the Ascians.

 Q>> Yda! Less provoking and more pummeling, if you would be so kind!

 Q>> [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]! Stay close to Biggs!

 Q>> ...More than are conducive to merriment.
Next time, Yda, have a care what you wish for.

 Q>> I cannot...go on...

 Q>> If the Garleans were alerted to our coming, we cannot know what they will do to Minfilia and the others. We must act with the greatest stealth.

 Q>> Yda and I shall go to reconnoiter Garlean activity at the stronghold. It would not do if something were to befall our comrades before we had the chance to act.

 Q>> Sometimes I wonder, Yda... Are there ever times when you are *not* enthused?

 Q>> To do otherwise would be to risk being caught 'twixt hammer and anvil.

 Q>> It is well the Garleans did not think to give it wings.

 Q>> The Ultima Weapon's destruction, 'twould seem, has served to embolden the beastmen, who now seek to call down their gods once more.

 Q>> So both Ifrit and Garuda are now vanquished by your hands. Truly, you have earned yourself a rest. Would that you had the luxury of time to enjoy it.

 Q>> It pains me to say that Titan is also returned, and with a vengeance. As was the case with his primal brethren, he is grown stronger than he was before.

 Q>> When I went about my investigation, all indications suggested that the kobolds were nowhere near ready to resume their summoning rites.

 Q>> But it turns out they were deceiving us. I should have known better.

 Q>> The kobolds' subterranean domain runs deep, and they can easily hoard crystals with our being none the wiser. And a vast hoard it must have been.

 Q>> Till now, Garuda was the most powerful among the three recently active primals. But according to our latest readings, Titan has usurped that honor.

 Q>> A primal's might is determined by two factors: the amount of crystals it has gorged upon, and the fervor of its believers. I would like nothing more than to measure precisely how strong the Lord of Crags has become, but I fear the time for such prudence has run out.

 Q>> We have already received an official request for assistance from the Maelstrom. And as you might expect, it is addressed to *you*.

 Q>> For your previous encounter with Titan, you traveled to his demesne by way of the aetheryte first discovered by the Company of Heroes. Sad to say, this aetheryte no longer seems to respond.

 Q>> But do not despair, for the Maelstrom has reportedly found another in its place. You will want to speak with Commander Rhiki at Maelstrom Command for the details.

 Q>> I cannot stress this enough, but Titan has grown fearsome strong. See to it you spare no preparation.

 Q>> Recall you our meeting with the Admiral, shortly after the Lominsans sent word of the summoning of Titan?

 Q>> Then mayhap you also recall my words to our host. I said unto Merlwyb that her people had broken their treaty with the kobolds, and that the beastmen had justly responded--that we had been called to intervene in a conflict which she herself had invited. I spoke, in short, the truth.

 Q>> And wherefore did I speak it? Because, owing no allegiance to Limsa, I felt no compulsion to allow the Lominsans to distort the facts to fit a narrative which justified their actions and absolved them of guilt.

 Q>> Upon this subject, Minfilia can expect a similar reply. Our many dalliances with the cityâ€“states have already weakened our claim to neutrality, but the path she contemplates would see us relinquish it entirely.

 Q>> A bittersweet victory, if truth be told. I cannot deny that I had come to look forward to Tataru's tales of our many guests and their many, many demands.

 Q>> Ah, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. Your assistance is most welcome.

 Q>> I have already spoken at length with the Brass Blades of the Rose--albeit to little avail. It would seem that the thieves took great pains to conceal their activities.

 Q>> I could go into further detail, but your time might better be spent in conversation with Fufulupa. He is the officer charged with leading the investigation, and I would only be repeating that which he related to me. If aught eluded my attention, mayhap it will not elude yours.

 Q>> We shall speak anon, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. I have a number of theories which I must needs consider further.

 Q>> ...A speeding carriage? That would seem a curious choice for thieves of such proven cunning.

 Q>> ...Yet the Amalj'aa do have a foothold in eastern Thanalan. Hmmm.

 Q>> Thancred is already afield with a unit of Brass Blades. I shall instruct him to take up a position to the east of the beastmen's encampment. Pray join him there.

 Q>> Pray do not tarry, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. Should violence erupt, Thancred may require your assistance.

 Q>> ...And so we find ourselves back where we began. <sigh> What have I overlooked...?

 Q>> Mayhap a more *subtle* approach is in order...

 Q>> Calm yourself, Fufulupa. What is this disturbing possibility of which you speak?

 Q>> Indeed. If, for reasons of security, the Concern decided to transfer the remaining crystals stored in Horizon to another location, their plans would be discovered the moment the Brass Blades were informed.

 Q>> Mayhap not. But neither would the Concern be eager to present them with such an obvious target. Nay, they might instead elect to carry out the transfer in *secret*--to entrust the goods to, let us say, a lone Miqo'te miner, traveling without escort so as not to attract undue attention.

 Q>> Meanin' no offense, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>miss<Else/>sir</If>--*I'd sooner be left in peace*.

 Q>> Stubborn to the last, as expected. You are unharmed?

 Q>> Sea Wolves? All of them?

 Q>> ...Our thieves are a long way from home.

 Q>> Thancred--if you would be so good as to attend to the outstanding matters in Horizon... I have inquiries to make.

 Q>> ...When last did we fight side by side, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]? Too long ago, I warrant. But come, let us away!

 Q>> Pray do not concern yourself--'twas but a glancing blow. Come, the aetheryte is close at hand--let us press on!

 Q>> To confront the Lord of the Whorl in his watery domain is far from ideal, yet he is not like to come to us. <sigh> Would that he lacked the means to strike us from afar...

 Q>> It will require no small amount of helmsmanship to tow the *Whorleater*. I daresay delivering you safely to Leviathan will be a battle in itself.

 Q>> It will require no small amount of helmsmanship to tow the *Whorleater*. I daresay delivering you safely to Leviathan will be a battle in itself.

 Q>> My congratulations, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. This victory will serve to quiet the Sahagin...for a time, at least.

 Q>> The abruptness of this development concerns me. Were we not keeping a close watch on the â€œtouched onesâ€� and their movements?

 Q>> If preparations for a summoning ritual were indeed underway, 'twould surely not have escaped your notice.

 Q>> I beg your pardon? You foresaw this eventuality and did naught to prevent it!?

 Q>> I am put in mind of Titan and the kobolds. Once again, it is the affairs of men which have paved the way for a primal's coming.

 Q>> ...A fond hope. Were such a thing possible, we would not have been at war with the beastmen since time immemorial.

 Q>> I am most curious to hear how the Elder Seedseer means to treat with Lord Ramuh.

 Q>> Trust not a word spoken here...

 Q>> <sigh> This is farcical...

 Q>> <cough> <splutter> Was that truly necessary?

 Q>> <cough> This one's trick has failed! But w-walking ones have not won yet!

 Q>> This one will not allow walking ones to pass! C-Come any closer, and this one's friends will be angry!

 Q>> Charming as ever. I daresay you are perpetually beset upon all sides by swooning beauties...?

 Q>> Enough. If this is not the real Thancred, then I believe we have found a suitable replacement.

 Q>> I would have words with my diminutive impersonator on the finer details of his portrayal...but the mission must take precedence. Mayhap 'tis best that you approach him alone.

 Q>> This one warned walking ones to stay away!

 Q>> <gasp> Walking one is too strong! This one surrenders. This one is sorry for playing tricks on wise ones.

 Q>> But great and powerful one, Lord Ramuh, is not here! So there is no need for wise ones to go any further. No, no--no need at all. Wise ones *definitely must not go any further*. This one would not want wise ones to get lost.

 Q>> Hmph. Well, at least the sylph offered some manner of apology for his mischief. But more importantly, his insistence that we proceed no further seems rather revealing, does it not?

 Q>> Hmph. Well, at least the sylph offered some manner of apology for his mischief. But more importantly, his insistence that we proceed no further seems rather revealing, does it not?

 Q>> 'Twould seem that Yda's appraisal of the situation held some merit after all. Mayhap I should not be so swift to discount her intuition...

 Q>> I fear Yda's boundless optimism is beginning to affect my better judgment. And your tendency to triumph against the most terrible of foes is certainly not helping matters.

 Q>> In my youth, I had the honor of studying under Matoya. In the field of aetheric research, she was without rival.

 Q>> I have no doubt that her knowledge will be of aid to our cause. The question is, will she share it with us? My master has ever been willful--the gods forbid anyone disagrees with her.

 Q>> When the Garlean Empire first marched upon Eorzea some fifteen years ago, the denizens of Sharlayan were summoned back to the motherland.

 Q>> However, Matoya refused to join the exodus. To this day, she lives a hermit's life on the fringes of the abandoned city.

 Q>> Oh, so it's to be a homecoming, then? As fine a reason as any to go to Sharlayan, and it would afford us the opportunity to pay my master a visit.

 Q>> 

 Q>> So this is the Holy See. I should like to linger awhile and take in the sights, but it must wait till after our mission.

 Q>> A long soak in the Lifestream followed by a long journey... I would not recommend it to anyone.

 Q>> But rest assured my strength is returning to me. I shall be back to my former self ere long.

 Q>> I believe I am sufficiently rested. Let us continue west to Sharlayan.

 Q>> Once we descend the mountain path, we will arrive at the Dravanian hinterlands. From there, it is but a short distance to the city.

 Q>> Be warned that we shall be passing through Gnath territory. We must needs be wary of them and the dragons both.

 Q>> Matoya dwells on the far side of the Thaliak River. Let us search for a crossing.

 Q>> The bridge ahead is collapsed; I am afraid we shan't be crossing there. But worry not, I know another way.

 Q>> See you the towering structure to the north? We should be able to cross there.

 Q>> â€œKnowledge Seeks No Manâ€�... So says the motto of Sharlayan engraved upon yonder stone. The meaning is simple: it falls to us to seek enlightenment.

 Q>> During the Sixth Astral Era, at the turn of the thirteenth century, men from the northern nation of Sharlayan journeyed across the seas to Eorzea in search of knowledge.

 Q>> Upon arriving at these shores, they established a camp for their scholarly endeavors. Over time, this camp grew into a settlement, and the settlement prospered, and so much so that it came to be counted amongst Eorzea's great cityâ€“states.

 Q>> Alas, those glory days are now but a fading memory. With her keepers lost to her, Sharlayan has become an empty husk of her former self.

 Q>> *Your* home? When last I looked, it was mine and Alphinaud's. We were *born* here.

 Q>> That is the short of it, aye. This place, Idyllshire--I came expecting a ghost town; suffice it to say I am surprised to find it so alive.

 Q>> So that is what happened after we Sharlayans departed...

 Q>> I suppose it's only to be expected that others would come and occupy Sharlayan. Nonetheless, it feels akin to having strangers take over your home in your absence.

 Q>> I suppose it's only to be expected that others would come and occupy Sharlayan. Nonetheless, it feels akin to having strangers take over your home in your absence.

 Q>> So we are to eliminate the golems. That should be a simple enough affair.

 Q>> The automata were employed as sentinels, and by design can be unmade with a coded command. At the time of the exodus, it was â€œNoughts and Crosses,â€� and I see no reason why it should not still work.

 Q>> Let us divide the task between the three of us, the quicker to be finished with it.

 Q>> Use the coded command â€œNoughts and Crossesâ€� to unmake the golems. If all goes well, we can accomplish the task without recourse to violence.

 Q>> I'm pleased to report that my golems obediently crumbled at my command.

 Q>> I am suddenly taken by a sense of foreboding.

 Q>> I'm pleased to report that my golems obediently crumbled at my command.

 Q>> I knew I recognized that voice... Greetings, Brayflox. It has been a while.

 Q>> Forgive us for interrupting your work, but Captain Wheiskaet gave me to understand that you are marked by the Illuminati. This happens to be Illuminati-held territory. Is it wise to be here?

 Q>> It appears we have no choice...

 Q>> Being embroiled in a cheese war was the last thing I expected coming to Sharlayan. At any rate, we have fulfilled Slowfix's request. Let us return with the good tidings and be on our way.

 Q>> One does not simply â€œdriftâ€� in the Lifestream; it is a constant struggle to hold on to your very essence. The experience has hardened me in ways I can ill explain.

 Q>> Whence came all these bombs!?

 Q>> Now seems as good a time as any...

 Q>> I shall invoke a spell!

 Q>> Pray keep the enemy at bay!

 Q>> It...it is done...

 Q>> My strength is spent...

 Q>> I must confess, at first it upset me to learn that my home had been occupied by others. But I see now that it is in good hands.

 Q>> Under your care, I look forward to seeing Sharlayan thrive once more, to become a home to people of all races and creeds.

 Q>> Alphinaud, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]--shall we, then?

 Q>> 'Twould be an understatement to say that I am quite ready to move on.

 Q>> I shall be very cross if we are asked to clear this mountain of rubble.

 Q>> Finally, we can continue our journey.

 Q>> Ahem. Barring any misadventure, we shall soon arrive at the cave where Matoya resides. Unless you have unfinished business in Idyllshire, let us strike out at once.

 Q>> Ahead lies the Answering Quarter, where the scholars of Sharlayan gathered to hone their knowledge.

 Q>> Even from this distance, 'tis plain that much of it has been given back to the wilderness.

 Q>> The cave in which Matoya resides is situated on the southern edge of the hinterlands.

 Q>> In choosing the spot, my master desired privacy above all else. As such, the cave is extremely well hidden; you'll not find it unless you know to look for it.

 Q>> We shall follow the road south until we reach a bridge. Rather than cross it, however, we shall ford the stream it spans, thence head straight until we arrive at the base of a bluff.

 Q>> This is the entrance.
...Hm? You seem unconvinced, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. Well, that will only add to the surprise.

 Q>> A word of warning before we proceed: stubborn geniuses make poor hosts, and time will have done naught to improve my master's temperament.

 Q>> Doubt not but that there will be sentinels and traps both to deter unwanted guests. But we'll not be deterred, will we?

 Q>> Go on and touch the wall yonder. You will want to have your weapon near at hand.

 Q>> What are you waiting for? Go on and touch the wall yonder.

 Q>> Those sentinels may suffice to discourage the average trespasser, but not the Warrior of Light.

 Q>> The way should now be clear. Come, let us go and see my master.

 Q>> Being here calls to mind my days studying under Matoya. Though she was the strictest--and most irascible--of mentors, she led by example and inspired one to greater heights. Were it not for her sage guidance, I should not be the woman I am.

 Q>> The Great Library was more than just a repository for tomes; it also served as a center of research for countless fields of study.

 Q>> Fields such as the development of arcane entities, the fruits of which were employed as the library's sentinels. Be ever on your guard, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT].

 Q>> Thank the gods. But another minute under Master Matoya's exacting supervision, and I would certainly have lost my mind--or mayhap merely my temper. Some things never change indeed...

 Q>> As you may have gathered, Master Matoya is not easily impressed.

 Q>> You have the tome, yes? Then hurry and show it to Matoya that I might be free of her stifling attention.

 Q>> 'Tis well that you were able to retrieve the tome. Had you failed, Master Matoya planned to have us take dictation while she quoted its contents from memory.

 Q>> (As if you could conceal it...from her of all people...) Hm? Pay me no mind. I was but thinking aloud.

 Q>> My lord. Pray excuse me for forgoing due pleasantries, but we seek your counsel regarding the aetheric ram. Though we now possess the knowledge to build such a device, we yet lack an appropriate source of energy with which to power it. We believe, however, that Ishgard may possess the solution to our problem.

 Q>> Greetings, Cid. It has been a while.

 Q>> This tome contains the fruits of my former master's research on a device known as an aetheric converger. Our ram should operate on the selfsame principle.

 Q>> So this is the fabled Eye... By the Twelve...it *seethes*. 'Tis a wonder such power can be contained, much less controlled...

 Q>> 

 Q>> I know naught of the archbishop and his knights save that which you have told me--but if they truly possess the power of primals *and* the secrets of Azys Lla, they are dangerous foes indeed. We must spare no preparation.

 Q>> I know naught of the archbishop and his knights save that which you have told me--but if they truly possess the power of primals *and* the secrets of Azys Lla, they are dangerous foes indeed. We must spare no preparation.

 Q>> What is a Scion but one who fights for our cause? Our hopes survive thanks to her sacrifice. Let that be enough.

 Q>> Yet I cannot help but wonder: how came she to know of our presence here?

 Q>> The Echo is a gift and a burden both...as you know only too well.

 Q>> Heavy though our hearts may be, we must forge on--in the name of those we have lost.

 Q>> Heavy though our hearts may be, we must forge on--in the name of those we have lost.

 Q>> Alas, I have found naught of use.

 Q>> Our imperial friends, I suspect. I hope they enjoy the defense system. But what of the archbishop and his cronies?

 Q>> I mislike the sound of this...which leads me to believe that it is indeed the place.

 Q>> No. Nothing at all.

 Q>> The Warring Triad puts me in mind of a tale from my childhood. It told of three gods locked in perpetual conflict.

 Q>> Though we know little of the node, we know still less of the facility at large. Let us see where it leads us.

 Q>> Mayhap the node has further instructions for us.

 Q>> Mayhap the node has further instructions for us.

 Q>> That node is not what it seems. From amidst the metal, I sense the gaze of a living being. Have care around it.

 Q>> That node is not what it seems. From amidst the metal, I sense the gaze of a living being. Have care around it.

 Q>> The Allagans did not respect life. Brilliant as they were, I cannot bring myself to respect them.

 Q>> What has gotten into Alphinaud all of a sudden?

 Q>> Alphinaud has come far. Master Louisoix would be proud.

 Q>> The next quadrant awaits. Let us make haste.

 Q>> I doubt that they will leave any time soon, however. Nay, they will remain here long after they have stripped the isle of all its secrets.

 Q>> Indeed. Let us avoid confrontations unless absolutely needful.

 Q>> 

 Q>> These soldiers bear the sigil of the VIth Legion, ordinarily deployed within Ilsabard. They are certainly a long way from home.

 Q>> (-Y'shtola-)Calm yourself, Slowfix.

 Q>> Ah, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. 'Tis well you are here, for our need is dire.

 Q>> A colossus of steam and steel has risen from the Thaliak.

 Q>> Yet it is no mere forgotten contrivance of Sharlayan. The resultant aetheric disturbance confirms that it is a primal, and that it was summoned amidst the ruins left for the river to reclaim.

 Q>> For a mercy, it stopped dead no sooner than it had broken the water's surface. But so long as it remains in our realm, it may spring to life again at any moment.

 Q>> Nay, the aether grows perilously thin, and more swiftly than I could have imagined.

 Q>> The primal is bleeding the land dry. Should it be suffered to continue, this entire region will become a barren waste in a matter of moons.

 Q>> And nor will we. I have already spoken with Alphinaud, and he concurs that we Scions of the Seventh Dawn must do all in our power to eliminate the threat. Yet given its size, I deem it wise to attack from two fronts.

 Q>> Our first and most obvious recourse is to keep our foe in check with blade and magic, much as we have done with other such adversaries. Second, I propose that we attempt to cut off the flow of aether which sustains it, mayhap by physically separating the primal from the land.

 Q>> If we are to be rid of the colossus, I think the latter course more promising, and mean to enlist Master Matoya's aid in pursuing it. Yet such things take time.

 Q>> Thus, I have asked Master Garlond to remain here and keep watch over our foe. Given its apparently mechanical nature, his expertise should prove invaluable to you.

 Q>> â€œTo you,â€� I say, for I would leave the fate of Idyllshire in your hands. Should the primal chance to stir ere my return, you are to join Cid in repelling it. An unenviable task, but one for which you are singularly qualified.

 Q>> Rest assured, I do not mean to linger with Master Matoya any longer than necessary. The moment we find a solution, I shall make haste to rejoin you here. Well then, let us be about our duties. I will leave you to discuss strategies with Cid.

 Q>> Ah, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]--'tis good to see you. I confess, I had assumed your business in Anyx Trine would detain you longer. Did your meeting with Vidofnir go well?

 Q>> She has, but when I explained that you would be joining us, she asked if she might use the intervening time to explore. I agreed to meet her outside on Frontbridge. We should be on our way.

 Q>> It would seem we are early. Shall we wait?

 Q>> The Crystal Eye is one of Master Matoya's most cherished relics. I doubt very much that she will grant us leave to lay hands upon it unless we can convince her that it is vital to our cause.

 Q>> You know how she can be. If Krile does not meet with her approval, then that will be that.

 Q>> Rest assured, they all are true. This way--and have care where you tread.

 Q>> Thancred may be a capable warrior, but he was wounded when last I saw him. If any beasts were nearby when he emerged from the Lifestream, he would have been hard-pressed to repel them.

 Q>> Ordinarily, perhaps, but in his wounded state, he may not have wished to risk contact with strangers of unknown allegiance. Yet even had Thancred chosen to remain in the forest, the hunters would surely have stumbled across his trail.

 Q>> This...this is impressive. You drew him from memory?

 Q>> 'Tis little wonder so many here have taken up hunting. The forest is teeming with wildlife.

 Q>> Many have made camp in inaccessible locations--ideal for hunting game, not so receiving visitors.

 Q>> ...You are implying that Thancred sent a Vath to market in his stead? Why would he not go himself?

 Q>> *Is it now*?

 Q>> Given that Alphinaud seems to recall the details of my return so *vividly*, I would rather he did not draw *me* from memory, talented or not.

 Q>> And where is he now?

 Q>> Ravana is returned!?

 Q>> We should be safe here. Our pursuers are not like to stray so far from the colony.

 Q>> 'Twould seem the mystery of the axe-wielding Hyur has been laid to rest. I should have known better than to think Thancred would ever stoop to using such an inelegant weapon... But then how was I to know there was not *one* vagabond wandering the Chocobo Forest but two.

 Q>> I recall no such adventurers--and I would not soon forget their like. Nor would any of us, I think.

 Q>> One of our primary duties was to scour the cityâ€“states for promising candidates--which is how <Switch(PlayerParameter(70))><Case(1)>I</Case><Case(2)>Yda and Papalymo</Case><Case(3)>Thancred</Case></Switch> found [WARRIOR OF LIGHT].

 Q>> I labor to believe that a band of preternaturally gifted adventurers has been traveling the land, slaying primals without our knowledge. 'Twould imply gross negligence on our part.

 Q>> Fortunately, the journey afforded us ample time to brief Thancred on recent events.

 Q>> We can but face them head-on, one at a time. For now, we must apply ourselves to our allotted tasks and leave the others to theirs.

 Q>> Remember, Thancred--we found you, as they found me. In time, we will find Yda and Papalymo and Minfilia as well.

 Q>> These troubles will soon be but a memory--one which we will look back on together.

 Q>> The archbishop may have fallen, but the legacy of his predecessors endures.

 Q>> Wooden dwellings built end-to-end and one atop another, each home to a family... How many were abed when the fires were set...?

 Q>> Good. Now that you are here, we can proceed with the interrogation.

 Q>> We found this man loitering near the remains of one of the stricken buildings. According to eyewitnesses, he was also present before the fires broke out.

 Q>> We wished to have words; he did not. So we insisted.

 Q>> And if our captive had called your bluff?

 Q>> The Temple Knights are interrogating the arsonist as we speak. Gods willing, we shall have more information ere long.

 Q>> How desperately we cling to that which we hold dear, knowing all the while that a day will come when we must let go.

 Q>> Concentrate on freeing the hostages. I will tend to their wounds.

 Q>> In the moments before Vidofnir appeared, I contemplated teleporting the girl. Thank the Twelve that I did not.

 Q>> Well-timed scarcely does it justice. But one moment later would have been a moment too late.

 Q>> A moment, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. I wish a word.

 Q>> Tell me, does Thancred seem quite well to you?

 Q>> That he did--which is especially remarkable given the injury to his eye. I can only assume that his time in the wilderness afforded him ample opportunity to compensate for his impairment.

 Q>> However, I speak not of his physical state, but rather his aetheric flow, which I fear has been irreparably disrupted.

 Q>> Of that I have no doubt. His time in the wilderness did not deprive him of his charm.

 Q>> But that is neither here nor there. What concerns me is his aetheric flow, which I fear has been irreparably disrupted.

 Q>> So you sense it too. A subtle change, imperceptible to most.

 Q>> I myself did not notice it at first, but upon closer examination, I saw that his aetheric flow had been irreparably disrupted.

 Q>> As a result, I strongly suspect that his ability to manipulate aether has been compromised. Simply put, Thancred may no longer be able to wield magicks.

 Q>> It would do much to explain why he chose to remain within the wilderness instead of seeking us out. He would have been compelled to rely solely on traditional methods of travel, significantly prolonging his journey. And when he learned that a nearby beast tribe was making preparations to summon a primal, it may well have seemed more sensible to wait.

 Q>> But this is still little more than speculation. Until I have proof, pray speak no word of it.

 Q>> Right, then. I should be on my way. Krile may have charmed Master Matoya for now, but who can say how long it will last.

 Q>> I will hold the entrance and look after this one. Now go!

 Q>> 'Twas rather less than I had hoped...though mayhap I asked too much.

 Q>> Hydaelyn. There is no other explanation.

 Q>> You are implying, I take it, that Hydaelyn guided Minfilia into the compass of my magick...that She might summon her, body and soul, unto the aetherial sea?

 Q>> In which case, we must needs continue our search there. For a blessing, the means to do so already exists.

 Q>> I speak of the Antitower--a Sharlayan construction conceived to provide scholars a vantage point over the aetherial sea.

 Q>> Though I know not where its entrance lies, we need only ask its last custodian--a contrary old crone who, for *another* blessing, refused to join the exodus.

 Q>> Is that all? I felt sure you would seek to dissuade us from our course, given your role as custodian.

 Q>> Thancred, no.

 Q>> Your aetheric flow has been compromised. Do not deny it. To venture into an environment so thick with aether, so close to the aetherial sea would be to risk further impairment--or worse.

 Q>> And you could *die*--and for what? If she is waiting beyond, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT] will find her. Trust in <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>. Have faith!

 Q>> Long did I wonder what waited beyond that door. Several times in my youth, I even tried to open it, but the wards placed upon it were far beyond my skill to dispel.

 Q>> Be that as it may, I hardly think the work of three Scions fair trade for its opening.

 Q>> The name does this establishment a disservice. Remarkably few of its patrons seem inclined to drink their way to oblivion. I do begin to see why Tataru chose to work here.

 Q>> An aetheric disturbance of this scale demands my personal attention. Judging by the marked fall in ambient aether concentrations, the situation is far graver than previously assumed.

 Q>> I can see no other explanation. The giant's innards are well-nigh saturated with aether already. Yet I sense something else... An irregular energy coming from within the barrier.

 Q>> Nay. Only the left arm stirs. Could the waves emitted by your device have disturbed something within the barrier, Wedge?

 Q>> I must needs discuss these developments with Master Matoya. Cid, would you be so good as to accompany me? Your insight may well prove useful.

 Q>> Cid insisted that I accompany him--though I would have come even had he not. Matters have taken a turn for the worse, I gather.

 Q>> The aetheric fluctuations are akin to those I observed shortly before the primal's awakening. In the absence of a functioning core, its form is dissipating, albeit slowly.

 Q>> That cannot be. Such a phenomenon is wholly without precedent. Knowing so little of this primal's capabilities, however, it would be remiss to discount the possibility outright.

 Q>> Ah, the treasure hunter of whom we have heard so much. You seem unperturbed by our outlandish speculations. Was this perchance the subject of Wedge's communication?

 Q>> Indeed. Given the nature of our adversary, none save those under the aegis of the Echo should be permitted to enter the containment facility. The risk of primal influence is too great.

 Q>> When â€œweâ€� locate the controls? Mayhap my words were unclear. Only those blessed with the Echo may safely enter the facility.

 Q>> The Garleans...
Come, Urianger, we must keep the imperials occupied.

 Q>> 'Tis plain your master found in you a willing student. Tell me, was it he who taught you of Allagan technology's â€œpotential for calamity,â€� or are those your own words?

 Q>> Well met, Unukalhai--and thank you for answering my summons so swiftly, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. We shall all be glad of your presence should we meet with the VIth Legion...as seems all but certain.

 Q>> As you may be aware, this facility houses some of Allag's most advanced technology. Accordingly, Urianger sought to deny the Empire easy ingress by weaving a ward of singular potency.

 Q>> That it is, Urianger--but 'tis a mystery for another day.

 Q>> I know of no such formula. Whence came you by this information? From your enigmatic master, perchance?

 Q>> Krile's sentiments reflect my own. Yet the two objectives need not be mutually exclusive... What say you, Urianger?

 Q>> After the legatus!

 Q>> ...And still they come!

 Q>> Press on, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. I will handle this!

 Q>> [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]!

 Q>> The tomelith is unbreached, then?

 Q>> ...Krile!

 Q>> Krile!

 Q>> Then we must redouble our efforts to protect this place. Krile and I will place additional seals upon the tomelith.

 Q>> 'Twould seem you have done some good this year. And so I come, bearing a gift from the Spinner. Do not ask why She chose *me*--surely this gaudy frock would better suit Yda, or Tataru...

 Q>> Still, it calls to mind one Starlight many summers ago, when I awoke to find a small ribbon beside my pillow. Master Matoya took me to task when I suggested she was the one who had placed it there. Still, I knew the truth, and was rather moved by the gesture.

 Q>> ...But l have dwelt on the past long enough.

 Q>> The dawn comes, and I am summoned elsewhere. Be well, friend--and do not neglect to look beneath the tree when you awaken.

 Q>> As agreed, we shall spend the coming moons conducting our own independent research. Should you have need of our services, however, you are of course welcome to seek us out.

 Q>> Ah, you are returned from the council. But what of Alphinaud? Did some other matter require his attention?

 Q>> Her wounds are healing well. With sufficient rest, I am certain she will make a full recovery.

 Q>> Now, mayhap you would share with us the council's decision?

 Q>> ...Which may equally serve as a way in?

 Q>> Four is quite sufficient for an infiltration mission. Greater numbers will only serve to increase the risk of detection. Krile and I will direct our energies elsewhere. What of you Leveilleurs?

 Q>> By the Twelve...

 Q>> Then mayhap it was the work of an Ascian. But now is not the time for idle speculation. Krile, I have need of your assistance.

 Q>> We must inspect the cocoon of light, and ascertain the state of the primal trapped within. Between our respective talents, I daresay we shall glean some measure of insight.

 Q>> As shall I. Let us be about it, then.

 Q>> I will stay with her a while longer...

 Q>> He seemed quite convinced that Quickthinx was a prophet of sorts--a traveler from the future come to the present to return history to its proper state.

 Q>> Having settled upon a plan of action, Cid and I were in the process of making our final preparations with Master Matoya when this kitten scampered in, mewing as if to beckon us. We duly followed her, and she led us here...much to the dismay of the fellow at our feet.

 Q>> ...Unless, that is, she took a shortcut through time. An implausible theory, I grant you, but one we cannot well dismiss in light of recent events. If true, it would raise a still more troubling possibility: that Roundrox's discovery of the codex was no mere coincidence, but an event orchestrated by Quickthinx to further his own ends.

 Q>> To travel back in time, and set past wrongs aright... Who could resist such temptation? And how grievous the consequences of surrendering to it...?

 Q>> For in allowing the past to consume us--and making our every choice, our every action the *correct* one--would we not cease to live in the present, and in turn lose sight of the future? 'Tis a path not to redemption but to madness.

 Q>> Good. 'Tis a relief to hear that at least one side of the operation proceeded according to plan.

 Q>> The same may not be said of the other. Our efforts to cut off the primal's source of aether proved wholly ineffective. Quite why, I cannot say--though I am hopeful that one among us can.

 Q>> Like all primals, Alexander constantly draws aether from its surroundings both to sustain itself and to gain in strength. Master Matoya and I believed we could disrupt or at the very least inhibit this process by means of arcanima.

 Q>> Yes and no. As far as we can tell, the arcanima are functioning precisely as intended. And yet--for reasons we have been unable to ascertain--they have had no measurable effect on the primal.

 Q>> *Travanchet*? I know the man. Our paths crossed during my time in Limsa, in the days before the Calamity. I might have guessed that the Ascians had a hand in this.

 Q>> The horn of which you speak was once rumored to reside on Seal Rock. It is a lost relic of the ancients with the power to manipulate the aetheric energy in the very air around us. The Scions have long pursued the horn, fearing the devastation that might ensue were an artifact of such power to fall into the wrong hands.

 Q>> Finally, I do begin to see...
If I have the right of it, Alexander's third core is using the horn to draw aether from far and wide. 'Tis little wonder our plan failed. Even without moving an ilm, the primal possesses the means to drain not just this land of aether, but our very star.

 Q>> Indeed. And yet we must be wary. We have seen the course of time reversed once before--we may well see it again. Even should we succeed in destroying our target, there is naught to prevent the Illuminati from simply returning the stricken core to its previous state.

 Q>> The Circle of Knowing once tasked me with recovering the horn, and 'twas through mine own negligence that Travanchet acquired it. That it now endangers our world is my responsibility. Even were I not a Scion, I should do all in my power to make amends. Whatever assistance I can offer, it is yours.

 Q>> And that must be the third and final core. Twelve have mercy... If you could but see the volume of aether issuing from it...

 Q>> ...'Twould seem we are back in our own time.

 Q>> ...Let us away. Quickly!

 Q>> Aye...we witnessed the truth with our own eyes. Sucked into the core of the colossus to sate the primal's appetite. If aught remains of him, it is no more than heat and light.

 Q>> The flow of aether to the core must be stopped. Pray lend us your strength one more time, child.

 Q>> 'Twould seem our work here is done. Let us take our leave.

 Q>> The codex responds... He means to return to the past!

 Q>> The core...! Without the codex to bridle its power, it rages out of control.

 Q>> It drinks in aether like no primal I have ever known. We must stop it now, lest Eorzea be bled dry!

 Q>> ...And she is not the naive child she was before.

 Q>> A noble wish, child...would that we could grant it. But I fear the steel giant--and all that lies within that barrier--is far beyond the reach of mortal hands.

 Q>> Two mews...? Might that suggest a willingness to try?

 Q>> Mayhap one day, when the perfect future they sought to bring about becomes a reality. In that sense, one might even say their fate is in our hands.

 Q>> ...As shall we, child.
And with that, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT], we must take our leave. For all you have done to stave off yet another primal threat, you have our gratitude.

 Q>> If you will be returning to the Shortstop, I would ask a small favor of you as well. Pray deliver this volume to Backrix, and tell him I believe it is that which he seeks. Till next we meet, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT].

 Q>> 'Tis well that you are here, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. I should like to know what our assailants were saying. You understood their words, did you not?

 Q>> And might we assume that this deity of theirs is the very eikon we've come to topple?

 Q>> Let us be about it, then. [WARRIOR OF LIGHT], Krile, Unukalhai--the three of you will make directly for Sophia's containment facility. Urianger and I will do what we can to occupy the eikon's thralls.

 Q>> I see the Goddess is no more. Well done. Once Krile and Unukalhai have rejoined us, we may safely depart.

 Q>> ...One thing yet puzzles me, however. How did Sophia's servants come to wake from their slumber?

 Q>> A foolhardy plan. Had it come to fruition, the two of them would surely have razed the realm. Naught would have been spared the devastation, the Meracydians' homeland included.

 Q>> Well met, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. You will forgive me if I seem curt, but I would settle an account with our young friend.

 Q>> While conducting a final sweep of Sophia's containment facility, we discovered that all of her remaining thralls had perished in their stasis chambers. This was your doing?

 Q>> You speak of Dalamud.

 Q>> You have made your case, and 'tis apparent that we were not in full possession of the facts. Nevertheless...

 Q>> Your notion of what may or may not be expected of [WARRIOR OF LIGHT] is presumptuous in the extreme.

 Q>> When the Warrior of Light chose to join the Scions, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> did so in the knowledge that <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> would be required to face and destroy not only the primals, but also their fanatical servants. That which you term â€œa distasteful taskâ€� is an essential part of our calling--a burden which every Scion is sworn to shoulder.

 Q>> No matter. Assuming I have made myself understood, we need not speak of it again.
There is, however, one other subject which merits discussion.

 Q>> You determined that Sophia's thralls were awoken by a Garlean soldier who had somehow gained access to the containment area, did you not? If that is the case, it seems highly doubtful that the interloper wandered into such a dangerous part of the facility by chance.

 Q>> Dissidents within the Empire claim that the VIth Legion is rife with agents under orders to thwart the legatus's mission by any means necessary.

 Q>> Lest you imagine that we have allies in Garlemald, I should clarify that their motive is wholly uncharitable. Regula van Hydrus rose to the top of the Garlean military on merit alone, and is fiercely loyal to the Emperor for recognizing his efforts. His compeers, by contrast, rose through the favor of the established order, and would accordingly do anything to see him fail.

 Q>> Aye--and that they pose no less a risk to the realm than those loyal to the Emperor. Plainly, we must needs continue to do all in our power to prevent the technologies of Allag from falling into the hands of man. On that point, at least, we have ever been in complete agreement.

 Q>> The Demon's worshipers yet slumbered when we confronted Sophia. Could the tampering of her thralls have been more widespread than we thought?

 Q>> 'Twas in opposing your reckless schemes that Ysayle was lost to us...
You expect us to simply forgive and forget all that has come before? 

 Q>> ...Then for better or worse, we shall fight at your side.

 Q>> Thus we are shown the error of our ways. I spoke of Ysayle, but she would not have approved of allowing such a horror to surface whilst we clung to old rivalries.

 Q>> Let us then hasten after the legatus and accept his offer. The Twelve forbid we be foolish enough to allow old grudges pave the way for Zurvan's resurrection.

 Q>> The Demon stirs...

 Q>> Hold! Witness your soldiers!

 Q>> He slumbers once more...

 Q>> 'Tis not often that I dare approach so closely to entities such as Zurvan. How sharply am I reminded of the burden we place upon those whom are blessed with the Echo...

 Q>> Krile has the right of it. The Demon has fallen back into torpor for now, but we must act swiftly if Regula's death is to have meaning.

 Q>> The survivors speak of an army of thralls loose in the facility, and we must assume that these followers continue their efforts to awaken the eikon.

 Q>> Every one of his thralls has been slain as far as we can determine. Our victory over the Warring Triad is complete.

 Q>> And when next we meet, our fleeting alliance will surely be forgotten. 'Twas an interesting exchange, nonetheless.

 Q>> They spoke of their present ruler as a man who values self-sufficiency. Varis befriended Regula in their youth, it seems, and was highly impressed by his martial prowess. 'Tis common knowledge that Regula's rise to legatus was in great part advocated by the Emperor himself.

 Q>> Regula freely admitted his shortcomings when it came to politics, and it was Varis's unconditional support that served to win his undying fealty. One does not expect such tales of comradeship to lurk beneath the Empire's iron exterior...

 Q>> Aye, the ideals you hold can be less important than having the faith to act upon them. Regula's loyalty to the Emperor guided his actions until the last, and though we did not see eye to eye on many things, his final deeds can be called naught less than heroic.

 Q>> ...Welcome to the Scions of the Seventh Dawn.

 Q>> I should hope you appreciate the irony of that statement, Urianger...

 Q>> ...In our absence, Urianger and Thancred will handle administrative affairs. Continue to coordinate your operations with Alianne and the others, and report to them directly should you receive word of primal activity.

 Q>> Though it may not be apparent to the naked eye, the aether here is in turmoil. Not since the Calamity has this land been subjected to forces of the magnitude unleashed by Shinryu and Omega.

 Q>> The Alliance has done well to repurpose these imperial facilities for their own use so quickly.

 Q>> Were Omega not a threat to us all, its effectiveness in subduing draconic foes would seem almost admirable. But such weapons are doomed to be misused. Let us pray we never have need of its services again.

 Q>> On your guard. The imperials know these lands better than we.

 Q>> We should not linger out here in the open.

 Q>> Lyse did well. It is...reassuring.

 Q>> ...Indeed. A glamour.

 Q>> Impressive or no, twenty years is a long time for even so complex a glamour to escape the Empire's notice...

 Q>> Fascinating... A massive, nigh-imperceptible glamour encompassing the entire valley... I see now how the settlement was able to escape the watchful eyes of imperial airships.

 Q>> Fascinating... A massive, nigh-imperceptible glamour encompassing the entire valley... I see now how the settlement was able to escape the watchful eyes of imperial airships.

 Q>> So they would have us wait. Very well.

 Q>> 

 Q>> 

 Q>> Krile and I shall remain here for now. Should you have need of us, you are welcome to visit.

 Q>> I am told you have been busy. As have we, lest you wonder. None here shall perish for want of proper treatment.

 Q>> 

 Q>> 

 Q>> 

 Q>> 

 Q>> 

 Q>> 

 Q>> Hm? Is aught amiss?

 Q>> ...I see. That would explain the sudden flurry of activity outside.

 Q>> ...I thought this a foregone conclusion given our actions thus far, but if you require renewed affirmation, then yes, I am still wholly committed to this cause. For it is ultimately the selfsame cause I have served since first I pledged to serve Master Louisoix and the Circle of Knowing: the salvation of Eorzea, by any means necessary.

 Q>> That said, I shall refrain from taking the field on this occasion. There are many here who require further treatment, and doubtless more to come after.

 Q>> Ah yes, asking everyone's opinion before making a critical decision. Truly, this is a far better arrangement than having centralized leadership.

 Q>> ...

 Q>> ...

 Q>> ...

 Q>> One can never be too careful when dealing with the enthralled.

 Q>> If the meeting is to be held in the throne room, 'twould seem wise to have eyes both inside and outside the palace.

 Q>> As fortune would have it, I was visiting Rhalgr's Reach to look in on Alisaie. She sends her regards.

 Q>> A primal's servant is betrayed by his aura. If you mean to conduct an investigation, I can identify any others acting under Sri Lakshmi's influence.

 Q>> Alisaie. [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. 'Tis good to see you safe and well. What news have you from the East?

 Q>> ...Disturbing developments indeed. Given all that we know, I too would conclude that an Ascian now inhabits Zenos's body. A doppelganger might fool the crown prince's subordinates, but [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]? Nay, Alphinaud had the right of it.

 Q>> Would that his wisdom extended to the question of his own safety. Capable though he has become, he ventures alone into the enemy's stronghold--and the shadowy web of the Paragons, like as not.

 Q>> Alphinaud will have need of all his wits if he is to survive his visit to Garlemald. We know precious little about life in the imperial capital.

 Q>> Tea would be lovely. You may regale me with the tale of your adventures in the Far East--and of your encounter with this new primal especially.

 Q>> It is pronounced â€œTsu-ku-yo-mi,â€� correct? A figure from Far Eastern mythology, no doubt...

 Q>> ...Interesting. So this Tsukuyomi was summoned in much the same manner as Susano--via the medium of a sacred relic.

 Q>> Given the danger they represent, it may behoove us to begin a catalog of such relics. But if we are to contain the threat, we will require a better understanding of the summoning method itself. I believe I shall pay a visit to Doma, and learn what I can on the subject.

 Q>> If Asahi was as fervent a devotee as you believe, he would not have been fooled by an impersonation, however committed. We must assume that we are dealing with an Ascian, and proceed accordingly.

 Q>> I understand your frustration, Alisaie, but [WARRIOR OF LIGHT] has the right of it. We must defer to Thancred's expertise in this matter.

 Q>> Alisaie and her brother bicker as all siblings do, but she worries for him nonetheless. 'Twould be a kindness if you were to visit from time to time, and distract her from her cares.

 Q>> See that you notify me too. I mean to depart for Doma as soon as I find a suitable East Aldenard vessel to bear me thither, but I shall return if I am needed.

 Q>> ...Hmm. That is curious indeed. While other matters demand my attention at present, I shall bear what you have told me in mind. Should you notice any change, do not hesitate to seek me out.

 Q>> ...Well, well. Two faces from the dim and distant past.

 Q>> A local miner who supplies crystals for the rebuilding effort. Of late, he claims to have struggled to find a crystal with so much as a trace of elemental energy.

 Q>> Upon learning that I had some knowledge of aether, he came seeking my counsel. Just now he brought me one of his recent finds.

 Q>> It was precisely as he described--devoid of elemental energy...and eerily reminiscent of the deaspected crystals that manifested in Eorzea in the days prior to the Calamity. We would be wise to investigate this phenomenon more closely.

 Q>> More *an interest in* than *a liking to*, I think. The sight of a Miqo'te with a peculiar contraption upon her head has a certain novelty value in these parts. Any actual regard they may have for me, I owe wholly to you and the others who came before. Everyone here has been exceedingly cooperative, and I am pleased to report that I have all but concluded my investigation.

 Q>> Simply put, by focusing one's will upon an aether-infused object of worship, it is possible to conduct a summoning.

 Q>> Correct. Such sacred relics as the Kojin collect obviate the need for religious fervor in the summoner--Yotsuyu being the most obvious example. She had but to associate the artifact given to her by Asahi with the divine, and it served to amplify her desires and give them form.

 Q>> A form nourished through the power of crystals, also provided by her brother. And thus was Tsukuyomi brought into being.

 Q>> Which brings me to the question of preventative measures--to which I have yet to find a satisfactory answer. At present, I know of naught that will avail us, save to keep watch over the movement of relics and crystals. As if we did not have enough to keep watch over already...

 Q>> ...But I doubt you came all this way to hear that which may be perused in a report. Has something happened to Alphinaud?

 Q>> ...Hm. I shall join you in the search, of course.

 Q>> Alisaie puts on a brave face, but she has little talent for concealment. We should join her at the Kienkan.

 Q>> My report can wait. Finding Alphinaud must take priority.

 Q>> My report can wait. Finding Alphinaud must take priority.

 Q>> The Burn offers a glimpse of the future we seek to prevent. Know you of any reason why Alphinaud might have gone there?

 Q>> With such a steed to bear me to and fro, I could perform my fieldwork in a fraction of the time. Mayhap I shall try my hand at this â€œBardam's Mettle.â€�

 Q>> On present evidence, we have no reason to fear the worst. More than that I cannot say.

 Q>> On present evidence, we have no reason to fear the worst. More than that I cannot say.

 Q>> Do not let us keep you then.

 Q>> That the Alliance would extend an invitation to Doma bespeaks the depth of their concern. Nor are they misguided. If Garlemald has fallen under Ascian control, the threat we face is incalculable.

 Q>> Had you not offered, I would have requested leave to remain. Where the Ascians are concerned, naught may be left to chance.

 Q>> I daresay I can guess the subject of your discussion with Lyse. She too was never one for concealment. Fortunately for you, the individual in question seems none the wiser.

 Q>> In the field of aetherology, the Azim Steppe remains unbroken ground. Having missed your last expedition through injury, I mean to seize this opportunity with both hands.

 Q>> So this is the Azim Steppe... The tales do not do it justice.

 Q>> An intriguing myth...though I wonder how Nhaama came to be woven into it. An Allagan hand, perhaps?

 Q>> So that is Cirina. Lyse told me something of the woman, but I did not think that we would ever have occasion to meet.

 Q>> ...However?

 Q>> It seems the time is come to put my skills to use. Pray lead the way to the House of the Crooked Coin.

 Q>> That such an abundant source of aether should lie undisturbed for millennia... 'Tis a miracle made possible by the Steppe's long history of isolation.

 Q>> The Dotharl. Lyse spoke of them. A warlike tribe possessed of unique customs and beliefs. I sense their cooperation will not be easily won.

 Q>> Great faith gives rise to great strength--for better or for worse. Whatever it is the Dotharl hold sacred, we would do well to accord it all respect.

 Q>> ...Namely?

 Q>> Try as I might, I fail to see the logic in this arrangement. I can but conclude there is none.

 Q>> ...Offended? Not in the least. I am no stranger to clumsy propositions, and that, believe it or not, was far from the worst I have heard.

 Q>> We have the requisite consent. 'Tis time to put Nhaama's power to use.

 Q>> If the aether flows as planned, all that remains is to have the Ironworks' engineers do their work at the ruins. Come, let us return to the House of the Crooked Coin.

 Q>> I shall begin at once. You may wish to step back.

 Q>> To manipulate aether in such vast quantities is draining to say the least. I shall take it slowly for a while.

 Q>> Agreed. The others may already have returned from their missions, and I would know how things stand.

 Q>> 'Twould seem we are the last to arrive.

 Q>> Indeed. We have secured a suitable source of energy for the barrier.

 Q>> Then let us not keep him waiting. Shall we?

 Q>> Let us hope that the coming meeting passes more peaceably than the last such gathering in Ala Mhigo...

 Q>> If the Ascians are indeed responsible, we must take steps to protect ourselves. Though I know not how...

 Q>> In *Thanalan*? Hm.

 Q>> As we alone were afflicted at the meeting, I had my suspicions, but if the voice also spoke to Urianger, there can be little doubt: the Scions were targeted specifically.

 Q>> By whom and to what end is the question. One to which we must find an answer with all possible haste.

 Q>> I shall be interested to hear how Urianger's experience compares to our own.

 Q>> You have been busy since arriving in the First, I gather. But I would hear the tale of your travails in more suitable surroundings.

 Q>> With Fort Gohn yet to be rebuilt, the Night's Blessed have made their home in a settlement to the northeast. I will await you at its entrance. Follow the path through yonder gate and you will find me soon enough.

 Q>> There you are. I was beginning to worry. Much like the Twelveswood, this forest has a way of dealing with those who stray too far from the beaten path.

 Q>> But I digress. Let me show you the home of the Night's Blessed.

 Q>> I am not indifferent to Thancred's troubles. Nevertheless, I will not apologize for holding him to a higher standard after all these years. He has ever been a man of considerable resolve, and that is what I will continue to expect.

 Q>> Though it heartens me to know that some of us remain ourselves in spite of our present circumstances.

 Q>> I can but imagine how Alisaie and Alphinaud have changed since arriving here in the First.

 Q>> <sigh> You're right. And after my untoward remarks to Thancred, no doubt he thinks I changed for the worst. I will have to speak with him later.

 Q>> I realize I am not as I was on the Source, but I cannot say I regret the decisions that allowed me to come this far.

 Q>> Ahem. Returning to the matter at hand--I really must begin work on deciphering this tablet. In the meantime, perhaps you should take a look about Slitherbough.

 Q>> If there is anything you need, pray speak with Runar at the plaza.

 Q>> I have instructed Runar to help you with anything you should require. 

 Q>> Good, you're here. Thanks to the Exarch's *gift*, our next course of action is now clear.

 Q>> Let me begin by first explaining the origins of this tablet.

 Q>> I initially believed it might detail the history of the Church of the First Light. Much to my surprise, it dates back to the end of the Ronkan Empire, and was likely written under the direction of the reigning ruler.

 Q>> It was a time of strife and unceasing war with neighboring nations. With each passing day they yielded more and more territory to their enemies.

 Q>> In their desperation, petitions for aid were sent out to their allies. This was one such petition.

 Q>> The problem, however, is I presently lack the resources to decipher them in their entirety.

 Q>> We have but one recourse: there exists a stone monument inscribed with ancient Ronkan text and translations into a more modern dialect which came into use after the fall of the empire. I am confident it will suit our purposes.

 Q>> Here in Citia, quite close to Slitherbough, in fact.

 Q>> The good news ends there, however, for it is in the possession of a rather radical faction of Dark worshipers--the Children of the Everlasting Dark.

 Q>> If I am to study the monument, I must infiltrate their encampment.

 Q>> I have no intention of taking longer than absolutely necessary, but I will nevertheless require time to transcribe the text I need. To ensure that I will have enough, I am afraid I must ask you and Thancred to assist me.

 Q>> Then let us convene outside, to the west of Slitherbough where the path diverges.

 Q>> The encampment we seek is to the north, but it would be foolish to simply rush in.

 Q>> A guard has been posted at Cleric to keep watch over the Children. Perhaps he has aught to share of their recent activity.

 Q>> But we must tread carefully. There is a chance we may encounter them along the way.

 Q>> Stay close and stay alert. I would avoid a confrontation if possible.

 Q>> They rejoice in dealing death to others, claiming that in doing so they cleanse their victims of sin and usher them unto the sunless sea. I would rather not sully my hands defending myself against such madmen.

 Q>> Thank goodness you are unharmed.

 Q>> Strange? What have you seen?

 Q>> It could be anything, really. If it meant the end of the Blessed, nothing would be too cruel or violent for them.

 Q>> But perhaps we can use their present preoccupation with spiders to our advantage.

 Q>> If we were to introduce a threat to the nests where they keep them, the Children would be compelled to save them. Bees, for example, are a natural predator of spiders.

 Q>> Set them loose on the nests and we would have our opportunity to sneak into their encampment.

 Q>> The guard returned to Slitherbough, but not before offering his thanks.

 Q>> As for the beehives, Thancred and I were successful in acquiring what we need. How did you fare?

 Q>> This is more than enough. The Children are certain to be displeased.

 Q>> Let us hurry, before the bees begin to stir.

 Q>> The Children's settlement is to the west, a place they call Woven Oath.

 Q>> According to the guard, there is an airway apart from the entrance which leads to the spiders' nests.

 Q>> If the fates are kind, the way will be clear.

 Q>> Up there is the airway. Do you see it?

 Q>> It sounds like our plan is working.

 Q>> Still, it is quite likely not all were drawn away from their posts.

 Q>> Your concern is appreciated, but I sincerely doubt it will come to that.

 Q>> Come now, Thancred. The shadows are a fitting place for a *Warrior of Darkness*. Now, if you both are ready?

 Q>> The Font of Seeing suggests this is a chamber for prayer. At the very least, they would not place this near potential distractions from their worship.

 Q>> Perhaps the monument is further in.

 Q>> Yes, this is it.

 Q>> I will be but a moment. Keep watch of the entryway.

 Q>> On second thought, would you mind examining the murals on these walls while I look over this?

 Q>> At a glance, I can tell they are old. Predating the founding of the Blessed and the Children, in fact.

 Q>> We're not like to come here a second time. 'Twould behoove us to learn all that we can.

 Q>> Hmmm... Then what does this mean...?

 Q>> I believe I now have everything needed to finish deciphering the tablet.

 Q>> Tell me, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT], did the murals appear to be of any significance?

 Q>> Depictions of heroes? From the age of gods, the Ronkan Empire, and immediately before the Flood.

 Q>> Very astute observations. Perhaps in another lifetime you could be a curator of antiquities.

 Q>> Though it has no bearing on the task at hand, perhaps that knowledge may prove to be of use in the future.

 Q>> 

 Q>> Let us hurry to Slitherbough. The others are waiting.

 Q>> After we've returned, the two of you should rest a while. No doubt Runar will be eager to have you sample his cooking.

 Q>> As soon as I discover anything of import, you will be the first to know.

 Q>> Please, go and rest. Urianger and I will call you the moment we finish.

 Q>> The poison spread throughout his system long before he was brought here. At present, there is naught we can do but try to ease his pain.

 Q>> ...Flee?

 Q>> I am not wont to run from my troubles. In fact, with [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]'s arrival, I am minded to take the offensive.

 Q>> The Eulmorans' presence here plainly stems from a desire to protect the Lightwarden. I say we seek it out and slay the creature before they return.

 Q>> Were darkness to fall over Rak'tika, they would have no cause to remain.

 Q>> I have, as a matter of fact. And with it we can prepare everything we need to enter Yx'Maja.

 Q>> What say you all? We will need to act quickly, but I believe it can be done.

 Q>> Good. I leave the Blessed in your capable hands, Runar.

 Q>> According to the tablet, we will first need to obtain a seal used to identify the allies of Ronka in times past.

 Q>> One such seal should be waiting for us in a complex of underwater ruins not far from here. You have some experience with subaquatic excursions, do you not?

 Q>> Then this should prove a simple task for you. The ruins we seek are at the bottom of Lake Tusi Mek'ta.

 Q>> There you are. Ready for a swim?

 Q>> The seal we seek should be stored in a chamber somewhere inside the ruins beneath the lake.

 Q>> However, the entrance is seemingly protected by a subtle locking mechanism rooted in the symbolism of Ronkan culture.

 Q>> The Ronkans sought to live in harmony with nature, and considered certain animals to be sacred. Foremost in their pantheon was the snake, portrayed as the protector of the wood, and arbiter of life and death. Below it were four others, each equal in rank: the coeurl, the colibri, the opo-opo, and the wolf, characterized as the bringers of liberty, words, enlightenment, and harmony, respectively.

 Q>> To open the chamber containing the seal, the tablet states that one must pay due deference to three of these beasts by placing one's palm on monuments wrought in their image, and that this must be done in a specific sequence.

 Q>> If my interpretation is correct, the order can be discerned from the three commandments which follow.

 Q>> â€œGive praise unto the snake. By its strength do our lands prosper.â€�

 Q>> â€œBe as the opo-opo, rival thy kin. As all parts seek betterment, so too does the whole.â€�

 Q>> â€œBe as the wolf, move as one. Peace comes to all who seek harmony with their kin.â€�

 Q>> The tablet says naught of the placement, size, or appearance of the monuments, alas. Hopefully all will become clear when you reach the bottom of the lake. Go safely.

 Q>> You have forgotten the sequence? <sigh> Mind that you listen this time, yes? The commandments were as follows...

 Q>> â€œGive praise unto the snake. By its strength do our lands prosper.â€�

 Q>> â€œBe as the opo-opo, rival thy kin. As all parts seek enlightenment, so too does the whole.â€�

 Q>> â€œBe as the wolf, move as one. Peace comes to all who seek harmony with their kin.â€�

 Q>> As I told you before, the tablet says naught of the position, size, or appearance of the monuments in question, so you will just have to use your eyes.

 Q>> I sensed a stirring in the water. Assuming you've found the chamber, it may be wise to check the entrance.

 Q>> Did you find it?

 Q>> This medallion... It bears the owl insignia of the empire. There can be no doubt--this is the seal of Ronka.

 Q>> Well done, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. We can begin our preparations to enter Yx'Maja in earnest.

 Q>> Bearing this seal, it should be possible to enter Yx'Maja unmolested by its guardians.

 Q>> I will go ahead to Slitherbough and inform the others. When you have recovered from your exertions, meet with us in the cavern leading east out of the village.

 Q>> Good, you're here. Runar opened the gate for us but moments ago.

 Q>> Beyond lies Yx'Maja, and presumably the Lightwarden.

 Q>> It did not take long for the wood's protectors to find me when last I came here, and I expect them to fall upon us just as quickly this time.

 Q>> Though we carry the seal, that is no reason for us to let down our guard.

 Q>> Now, let us seek out the Warden, and put an end to its reign over these woods.

 Q>> Straight to the point, I see. Very well.

 Q>> I beg your pardon?

 Q>> No dawdling. Once we have learned all we can of the Warden and its whereabouts, we should be on our way.

 Q>> And you believe we are the allies for whom you have waited?

 Q>> We have leave to speak with the other Viis, then?

 Q>> Then we should split up and inquire individually. If someone knows something, I would hear it while there is yet time to act.

 Q>> Were you able to learn aught of the Warden's whereabouts?

 Q>> I have never heard of this Rak'tika Falls. I can but assume it lies deep within the woods of Yx'Maja.

 Q>> Can it be opened?

 Q>> It would seem we have our work cut out for us, then. Shall we?

 Q>> Let us be about it then.

 Q>> While we attend to matters at the K'mul Astropolis, I would ask that your sisters accompany Urianger and Thancred, and share with them all they can of these woods.

 Q>> While we have every intention of investigating Rak'tika Falls, 'tis yet possible the Lightwarden dwells elsewhere.

 Q>> With that in mind, it would behoove us to prepare an alternative course of action.

 Q>> We must make haste and see this done. The Qitana Ravel and the Lightwarden await.

 Q>> Looking upon these structures, I cannot help but be reminded of ruins in Gyr Abania. Yet the manner in which they appear to be suppressing the natural flow of aether is more akin to the Allagan pillars in the House of the Crooked Coin...

 Q>> ...Another puzzle. Wonderful.

 Q>> I would have a closer look.

 Q>> It is indeed another puzzle, but for a blessing, it appears to be similar to the one we encountered at the lake.

 Q>> These statues are all depictions of the divine beasts mentioned on the tablet.

 Q>> No doubt they will open the way into the pyramid in like manner.

 Q>> We have but to discern the correct order. Let's split up and search the area for clues.

 Q>> Indeed. It may be best to transcribe them if they are as numerous as you say. Better that than risk overlooking something.

 Q>> Though transcription would prove impractical for you, not being versed in Ronkan script... No matter. You will employ a different approach: impressions.

 Q>> Here. I had thought to use these clay tablets to record any significant imagery we discovered, but they will serve you just as well. Take impressions of any inscriptions you find.

 Q>> We will start at the base of the pyramids. You begin at the top.

 Q>> When you have finished, return here and I will translate your findings.

 Q>> Did you find anything?

 Q>> I trust you've made good use of those clay tablets?

 Q>> Well done. A moment while I decipher what you've found.

 Q>> Apologies for the delay.

 Q>> Nothing we saw at the base of the pyramids gave any hint as to the solution of the puzzle, focusing instead on how to proceed having solved it. Your findings, on the other hand, appear to form a riddle. Once assembled, it reads as follows...

 Q>> â€œCome together, share despair.

 Q>> â€œGo thy ways, dread burdens bear.

 Q>> â€œMark the crown, heed its call.

 Q>> â€œAvert thy gaze, forever fall.â€�

 Q>> I had assumed that the puzzle would involve a sequence, but from what Almet and I were able to gather, it is but a matter of suffusing one of the statues with aether.

 Q>> The question being: which one?

 Q>> Have you any thoughts?

 Q>> Given your talent for finding solutions to vexatious problems, I think it best that you choose the statue. What say you, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]?

 Q>> If you need more time to consider, take it--but do make haste. I *would* suggest seeking Almet's counsel, but she seems rather preoccupied with reciting the riddle.

 Q>> At the very least, you should consider having a second look at the statues themselves. Perhaps they offer some clue as to which is the correct choice.

 Q>> Right, then. After you have selected a statue, I will imbue it with the required aether.

 Q>> Should it prove to be a trap, I am more than capable of warding off any malign magicks it may contain.

 Q>> Now, which statue will it be?

 Q>> All right. I pray this works.

 Q>> Gah! ...It seems you were mistaken.

 Q>> I am fine. Though I would rather not go through that again.

 Q>> Next time, choose more carefully.

 Q>> All right. I pray this works.

 Q>> The aether has been absorbed...

 Q>> You really do have a talent for these things.

 Q>> A moment. Maintaining my wards has proven more taxing than anticipated.

 Q>> Eulmoran soldiers!? And what of the Blessed?

 Q>> Though I knew time was short, I did not expect the Eulmorans to move so swiftly...

 Q>> But we have come too far to turn back now.

 Q>> I swear, if the Eulmorans harm so much as a hair on the heads of the Blessed... 

 Q>> Our way has been barred...again. I am beginning to lose my patience.

 Q>> Magic appears to be flowing through the walls, but it's being obstructed as it approaches the door.

 Q>> ...Hmmm. Is it not strange that only one of these pedestals bears an owl statue?

 Q>> We can cover more ground if we split up. Almet, take the chamber to the south. [WARRIOR OF LIGHT], the one to the east.

 Q>> I will search the chamber to the west.

 Q>> Still no sign of the statue. It has to be around here somewhere...

 Q>> One might assume so, but nothing about these ruins has ever been quite so simple.

 Q>> I sensed a strange energy emanating from the eyes of the statues in the corridors of this place. Should this figure be moved, it would not surprise me for them to suddenly stir to life.

 Q>> Precisely. Caution would serve us well here.

 Q>> Which is why I would ask you to deliver this statue to the main chamber.

 Q>> An abundance of magick yet courses through these walls. For my eyes, distractingly so. I believe yours, on the other hand, would more aptly perceive the traps for what they are.

 Q>> All right, then. We will meet you at the door to the Confessional of Toupasa the Elder.

 Q>> Beware the stare of those statues, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. I dare not think what will happen should they catch sight of you.

 Q>> I believe it was. I can see aether flowing to the door now.

 Q>> I pray this means an end to the tricks and traps of these ruins.

 Q>> Well done.

 Q>> The sooner we can enter the Qitana Ravel, the better.

 Q>> A path laden with more puzzles and traps, I'm sure. Did the emperor always take such pleasure in wasting the time of his allies? 

 Q>> <sigh> Let us end this, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. While time is yet on our side.

 Q>> Let us do what needs be done and quit this place. We've precious little time.

 Q>> I think [WARRIOR OF LIGHT] and I can work out how to use these well enough. Thank you.

 Q>> All right, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. The sooner we finish here, the sooner we can return to the others.

 Q>> Shall we get this over with?

 Q>> Did Emet-Selch not return with you?

 Q>> My apologies for having put you all through such an ordeal. I could see no other way to save the Night's Blessed. Happily, both they and I yet live--thanks to you.

 Q>> But our work here is not yet done. We must make ready to enter the Qitana Ravel, and put the Lightwarden to the sword.

 Q>> Tell me, what has happened since our encounter with the Eulmorans?

 Q>> Before we leave--Urianger, did you discover anything that may suggest the Lightwarden hides elsewhere?

 Q>> Then our course is clear.

 Q>> We must navigate the Qitana Ravel and make for Rak'tika Falls.

 Q>> I fully intend to survey every ilm of it--once our mission is complete.

 Q>> You need not worry, Runar. I shall return, and bring with me a long-awaited gift. One the Night's Blessed will treasure now and forevermore.

 Q>> Now, let us away.

 Q>> This had better work. I have no wish to return to the Great Pyramid.

 Q>> Our earlier efforts were not in vain, it seems.

 Q>> Stay on your guard, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. We know not what awaits us inside.

 Q>> I never did tell you why I chose to take up thaumaturgy, did I?

 Q>> As you will no doubt have noticed, life here in the First can be exceedingly unforgiving. Brutal, in a word.

 Q>> I had not long been in Norvrandt when I realized my mastery of conjuring magicks would not suffice to protect the people. 'Twas a struggle at first to embrace the change, but I confess the path of the thaumaturge suits me rather well.

 Q>> That was an enlightening experience. Though not in the way I had hoped.

 Q>> Do you suppose there is any truth in Emet-Selch's claims?

 Q>> Though recent events plainly warrant further discussion, I think it best that we wait until Alphinaud and the others are present.

 Q>> ...Emet-Selch included. How convenient that he should choose this moment to keep to the shadows.

 Q>> Well...no matter. For the present, we should return to Fanow and make certain of the Eulmorans' withdrawal.

 Q>> After that, Slitherbough. The Blessed are no doubt elated by what has become of the sky.

 Q>> Indeed. I am pleased to report that the Lightwarden is no more, thanks in large part to you.

 Q>> It is we who should be thanking you. Our journey through the Qitana Ravel proved...most enlightening.

 Q>> To be privy to such knowledge is an honor. One for which we never hoped...

 Q>> Thank you, Almet. I look forward to a day when we might share a more leisurely visit to the ruins of Ronka.

 Q>> Though it pains me to leave, it is time I returned with you and the others to the Crystarium.

 Q>> But before we go, might I speak with you in private? I will await you in my chambers.

 Q>> Thank you for coming. I thought to keep my suspicions to myself, but after witnessing your victory at Rak'tika Falls, I fear they prove true, and so I must share them with you.

 Q>> From the first when we met at Fort Gohn, your aether has appeared...tainted. Suffused with an overabundance of light not unlike the sin eaters.

 Q>> When you defeated the Lightwarden, I fear the light which poured forth from it was not negated by Hydaelyn's blessing. Rather, it was absorbed into your being.

 Q>> Urianger also suspects as much, though he is unwilling to share his thoughts on the matter.

 Q>> One thing is certain: with every Warden you defeat, the danger to you grows greater. Greater perhaps than we can imagine. If you begin to feel anything strange--anything at all--pray inform me at once.

 Q>> You should hurry, before the others begin to worry. Once I have sorted my things here I will join you.

 Q>> Pray go on ahead. I would first attend to this unsightly collection of books.

 Q>> <sigh> I'd always complained that her cave was such a mess, books and scrolls strewn about like a child's playthings. Gods, I really *am* turning into her...

 Q>> Sorry to keep you all waiting. Shall we be off, then?

 Q>> ...I'll not deny there is a part of me that wishes I could stay.

 Q>> For two years I have lived with the Blessed, learned their culture, even going so far as to adopt Master Matoya's name as my own. I but pray I did honor to it.

 Q>> Now is not the time for doubt or hesitation. Come, we must return to the Crystarium.

 Q>> All things considered, it is hardly surprising that Alphinaud and Alisaie have yet to arrive, but where is the Exarch?

 Q>> Alphinaud! It has been too long.

 Q>> I thought to propose the very same. After your clash with the Warden, you deserve a chance to recuperate.

 Q>> Take a deep breath for me. That's it...

 Q>> A timely arrival, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. I have my hands full here.

 Q>> The eater's aether swells. I would hate to find out what it intends to do next.

 Q>> Defend me--let none interrupt my incantation.

 Q>> Master Matoya has a few tricks up her sleeve. Allow me to demonstrate.

 Q>> As if you've none of your own. Let's make for the Imperative, shall we?

 Q>> These eaters are too organized. They cannot merely be acting on instinct.

 Q>> More eaters...

 Q>> They're protecting it, somehow. We shall need to deal with them first.

 Q>> ï¼ˆâ˜…æœªä½¿ç”¨ï¼�å‰Šé™¤äºˆå®šâ˜…ï¼‰

 Q>> I have faith in you.

 Q>> You must carry on...

 Q>> Take a deep breath for me. That's it...

 Q>> I assume Vauthry's words were heard in the Crystarium as well. We can only hope that they don't incite the unrest he so clearly hopes for.

 Q>> Minfilia demonstrated impressive resolve just now. It seems that she understands what must be done...though I do wonder if she is truly prepared to make the choice.

 Q>> Should she falter, it will fall to Thancred to guide her. However much he wishes it were otherwise.

 Q>> When you put it that way, how could we not?

 Q>> It is your decision to make. Just be sure that you are prepared, when the time comes.

 Q>> I will accompany you as well. It will afford us a chance to have a proper conversation.

 Q>> ...And if I go with the others, I'm likely to say something Thancred will regret.

 Q>> Welcome back. I see you fared better than Thancred.

 Q>> Ryne's aether has changed. It has taken on a faint, golden hue. Curious...

 Q>> We thought it prudent to take a brief survey of the area prior to your arrival.

 Q>> To the west we found the remains of a site known as Malikah's Well.

 Q>> If I recall correctly, the well was built in remembrance of one of the ancient kings of Nabaath Areng to serve as a source of respite from the desert heat.

 Q>> It fell into disuse after the Flood, whereupon the miners of Amh Araeng thought to turn part of it into an excavation site.

 Q>> Though I cannot see it as you do, it is a no less awe-inspiring sight.

 Q>> I was surprised to hear Ran'jit survived the fall. Though I suppose I did the same.

 Q>> More surprising is how he so readily saw through our diversion.

 Q>> A foe possessed of such cunning would be sufficient cause for concern in itself, but one capable of besting Thancred in combat too...? We would do well not to underestimate him when next we meet.

 Q>> Is this not the moment Emet-Selch usually chooses to descend upon us? Whatever will we do without his feigned praise and backhanded compliments?

 Q>> Is this not the moment Emet-Selch usually chooses to descend upon us? Whatever will we do without his feigned praise and backhanded compliments?

 Q>> She sees it too, then.

 Q>> The others are with the Exarch. Before we join them, there is something I wish to confirm.

 Q>> Tell me, Ryne--have you noticed anything peculiar about [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]'s appearance of late? Anything at all? Speak freely. <If(PlayerParameter(4))>She<Else/>He</If> won't mind.

 Q>> Then it is as I suspected.

 Q>> How are you feeling?

 Q>> [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]!

 Q>> If naught is done, this will only get worse.

 Q>> Ryne--with the power of the Oracle, you have gained some measure of control over Light, have you not? Is there anything you can do for <If(PlayerParameter(4))>her<Else/>him</If>?

 Q>> Then we have no choice but to rely on Urianger and his secrets.

 Q>> If the next battle is to be the last, you may yet be able to play your part. But you will need all of your strength.

 Q>> I will discuss strategy with the others and see that everything is made ready for our departure. You are to return to your chambers and rest until then. Understood?

 Q>> Good. Whether you want it or not, you have most certainly earned some respite.

 Q>> This is not the time for false bravado. Should your condition worsen, it could have dire consequences for us all.

 Q>> Now please, return to your chambers and rest.

 Q>> Hah. None of that cheek, or I will take you across my knee.

 Q>> Now, off with you to the Pendants. We will call for you when the time comes.

 Q>> That Vauthry should so brazenly exert his influence over the people bespeaks his desperation. He will not go quietly.

 Q>> So this was how the citizens lived--the Eulmoran dream. They are in for quite a rude awakening.

 Q>> There is no end to them... Urianger--would you care to make a stand?

 Q>> Ungh... Not like this...

 Q>> So this was how the citizens lived--the Eulmoran dream. They are in for quite a rude awakening.

 Q>> Bottom Rung, they call this place. How very apt.

 Q>> Apparently, it used to be the control center for the Ladder and a bustling hub of transport. Its glory days are far behind it.

 Q>> By the intensity with which he works, 'tis as if all of that reluctance was a lie.

 Q>> By the intensity with which he works, 'tis as if all of that reluctance was a lie.

 Q>> Forgive us our delay. The Exarch arrived and we took some time to apprise him of our mission.

 Q>> Forgive us our delay. The Exarch arrived and we took some time to apprise him of our mission.

 Q>> Ah, good of you to join us. I'm pleased to say we have gathered ample help for the imbuing.

 Q>> With Master Chai in the process of finalizing his design, I have taken the liberty of dispatching all hands to their positions.

 Q>> Runar, mayhap now is a good time to bring them out.

 Q>> Immersed in water imbued with fervent prayer, these stones harbor no small amount of magic.

 Q>> And we may imbue them with yet more prior to their installation on the Talos. What think you?

 Q>> So, Master Chai. If you could instruct us how to distribute the heartstones?

 Q>> And [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]--for good luck, may I ask that you imbue one as well?

 Q>> Rest assured it is not difficult. Simply raise your hand and focus as you would when attuning to an aetheryte.

 Q>> Imbue the jade-colored stone here, if you would be so kind.

 Q>> Go on, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. Imbue the stone.

 Q>> That will do. Thank you, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT].

 Q>> If this heartstone appears familiar, it is because it belonged to Toddia.

 Q>> It bears the collective hope of the Night's Blessed--the hope that none shall ever again be sacrificed to sin eaters.

 Q>> Understood. We will set about the task at once.

 Q>> A moment, Urianger. You said that you would have measures ready in the event that our friend fails to contain the Light. Do you?

 Q>> Everyone is here. Good.

 Q>> The Talos has taken hold of the mountain. As planned, we will use its body as a bridge to reach Vauthry's sanctuary.

 Q>> 'Tis a trivial concern, but I cannot help feeling self-conscious knowing that some of the Night's Blessed are watching.

 Q>> In the guise of Master Matoya, I took great pains to cultivate an image of restraint. Yet I don't suppose they will be able to make out all that much from such a distance...meaning I may wreak havoc to my heart's content. I do believe I'm going to enjoy this.

 Q>> A dramatic transformation. The result of the sin eater within emerging to claim dominance, I assume.

 Q>> The volunteers who journeyed to Kholusia have all been safely returned to their homes. They've also assured us that they will do their best to hold the eaters at bay in our absence.

 Q>> The volunteers who journeyed to Kholusia have all been safely returned to their homes. They've also assured us that they will do their best to hold the eaters at bay in our absence.

 Q>> If you've solved Urianger's little mystery, then you can find him further up the slope. 'Twas all rather obvious to my eyes, though I concede I have an unfair advantage.

 Q>> I daresay Urianger endured much â€œplayfulâ€� attention from the pixies to learn the lore of Bismarck. He is nothing if not a dedicated scholar.

 Q>> I daresay Urianger endured much â€œplayfulâ€� attention from the pixies to learn the lore of Bismarck. He is nothing if not a dedicated scholar.

 Q>> The ocean floor is a strange place to be, of course, but this aether...'tis like naught I've ever seen.

 Q>> I cannot say for certain, but I sense this tribe has a deeper connection to the Ascians than first meets the eye.

 Q>> It warrants further investigation. Thus I cast my vote in favor of aiding the settlement for the time being.

 Q>> Ah, as I suspected...

 Q>> ...Ah, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. Have you learned aught of note?

 Q>> Fascinating...and precisely the sort of information I was hoping to hear.

 Q>> In fact, if you have a moment, I'd like to borrow your eyes to confirm a theory I've been working on. Come.

 Q>> Now, there are two tasks I would have you perform.

 Q>> The first requires you to inspect the buildings which surround the Ondo settlement, and note their most distinctive characteristics.

 Q>> For the second, I wish you to use this knife to take scrapings from one of the remnant walls.

 Q>> Pray be as thorough as you can. I shall be waiting here for the results of your investigations.

 Q>> 'Tis strange to be here, under the ocean. It seems a lifetime ago that we stood amidst the trees of Rak'tika...

 Q>> And what have you discovered?

 Q>> Yes, I would agree that the windows are most distinctive. 'Twould seem the structures appear the same to both your sight and mine...

 Q>> And you say you could not so much as scratch the wall? Even with all your might behind the blade?

 Q>> [WARRIOR OF LIGHT], everywhere I turn in this place, my gaze is drawn by peculiar materials for which I do not have a name.

 Q>> The buildings I had you investigate are prime examples. They may appear to be constructed of ordinary stone, but I assure you it is nothing of the sort...

 Q>> If pressed, I would describe the substance as a composite of several mineral properties, blended to create a material of unparalleled durability.

 Q>> Even the Ronkan Empire, once the greatest power in Norvrandt, produced nothing which compares to this level of perfection.

 Q>> But if not the Ronkans, then who? Who were these ancients the Ondo claim as the architects of their sanctuary?

 Q>> I suspect our answer lies with the reason Emet-Selch withdrew here to the Tempest.

 Q>> He may simply have wished to retreat somewhere mere mortals would struggle to reach...but there are many such remote locations. Why here, specifically?

 Q>> Emet-Selch is devoted to his role, and thus we might assume his choice of stronghold somehow serves the Ascian agenda.

 Q>> Or mayhap...'tis a place more dear to him than any other.

 Q>> That is my theory, that these structures are remnants of a time before history--of a star that was yet whole and unbroken.

 Q>> That was my first thought as well. Yet no matter how superior the materials, a ruin is just a ruin. 'Tis naught that would decide a battle's outcome.

 Q>> Which brings us to my second theory: that he has some other, more personal connection to this site. What if these structures are remnants of a time before history--of a star that was yet whole and unbroken?

 Q>> It is my theory that these structures are remnants of a time before history--of a star that was yet whole and unbroken.

 Q>> Such traces in the Source would have been obliterated by the succession of Umbral Calamities, but here in the First they might have remained untouched for millennia...

 Q>> ...A copy of the mural in the Qitana Ravel. Almet presented it to me during my visit to Fanow, after our victory in Kholusia.

 Q>> Here, in the first scene...
By Emet-Selch's own words, it depicts a city of eons past and the disaster which befell it.

 Q>> The design is much simplified, of course, but do you see the similarities between its towers and those you have just inspected?

 Q>> We are close to the truth, I feel. Let us search the surrounds for another tower--one which matches the picture near enough to remove all doubt.

 Q>> From what I have seen, naught more than sand and more sand lies to the east, and the south held no such structures. I suggest we try our luck further to the northwest.

 Q>> Aye... This is the mural writ large...

 Q>> Though I cannot guess at its purpose, it must have been an imposing sight. How much of the tower's height lies hidden beneath the ground, I wonder...

 Q>> Centuries of our history have settled upon such ruins. Countless layers of dust and sediment...

 Q>> ...An entire civilization, its existence forgotten by all except a handful of Ascians.

 Q>> And yet it did exist. They lived here, in this city...

 Q>> But let us focus on what we've learned thus far. The Ondo chieftain spoke of mysteries stirring--of a land illuminated.

 Q>> Judging by his words, he believes this phenomenon related to the ancients' return.

 Q>> Thus can we surmise that what the Ondo saw shining in the abyss was, in all likelihood, yet another remnant of this age-old civilization.

 Q>> And who else would â€œlight the lanternsâ€� as Ryne put it, than Emet-Selch himself? 'Tis almost certain he is there!

 Q>> But if we are to find this stronghold in a timely manner, it seems gaining the Ondo's trust remains our swiftest path forward.

 Q>> I only hope our deeds are enough to win them over...

 Q>> Thank you for assisting me with my investigations. I shall seek out our companions and share what we have learned.

 Q>> ...Much as I would like to tell you to sit down and leave the rest to us, your condition demands that we make all reasonable haste.

 Q>> If you are not too weary, it may be useful to speak with Paushs Ooan again, and ask if there is aught else he is willing to divulge.

 Q>> You have everything you need? If that artisan fellow is as skilled as they say, then you may wish to avail yourself of his services ere we press on.

 Q>> The rock drops off sharply here, but I should think this coral thick enough to serve as a bridge...

 Q>> ...Well, that was rather more arduous than expected. I feel a sudden rush of gratitude for the smooth roads our ancestors cut through the wilderness.

 Q>> If we weren't so pressed for time, I should like to explore these side passages. Mayhap another day.

 Q>> [WARRIOR OF LIGHT], did you note the style of the architecture? 'Tis the same used for the remnants at the Cups and the mural's painted towers.

 Q>> Look closely. Emet-Selch has not simply reclaimed these ruins...he has layered the semblance of an entire city upon them.

 Q>> Gods, the magnitude of his artifice is staggering. Though it pains me to admit, we did not fully understand the feats of which an old world Ascian is capable...

 Q>> We have found our destination, but how to descend into the city itself...?

 Q>> And where will this lift be taking us?

 Q>> Well, there you have it. In the absence of some few hundred yalms of rope, we have little choice but to accept the offer.

 Q>> Just a moment. I thought I saw something.

 Q>> Just as he understood us.

 Q>> To my eyes, these people appear as arcane entities. I suspect Emet-Selch wove them from aether, much as he reconstructed the rest of the city...

 Q>> 'Twould seem our conversations were much alike: a looming disaster, creation magicks running rampant, and this Convocation's efforts to bring salvation out of chaos.

 Q>> Ah, Urianger, if I may. What are your thoughts on the ancients' art of creation?

 Q>> I see we arrived at the same conclusion, then.

 Q>> The people who lived in the age before the sundering were blessed with vast reserves of mana...

 Q>> No matter how draining these creation magicks must be, it seems they paid the cost with naught more than a fraction of the aether which coursed through their own bodies.

 Q>> If we were to attempt the same, such spells would soon deplete our energies, and then seek to draw the balance from elsewhere--from a hoard of crystals, mayhap, or from the very land itself.

 Q>> Thus when this art of creation was placed into our hands, it became, in effect, a means for destruction.

 Q>> Ah, good, you're here. Everyone seems to be present and accounted for...

 Q>> What of you, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]? Was aught worthy of interest said during your efforts to obtain a writ?

 Q>> ...Aye, I thought we knew their intentions in full: restore the world to its former glory, and, in turn, empower Zodiark to reclaim His throne as the will of the star.

 Q>> Yet that was merely a step along the way. I hesitate to put it into words, but we have to assume that following the final Rejoining, the Ascians mean to draw on the lives of the Source to make their sacrifice to Zodiark.

 Q>> The decision to press on lies with you. Just as it lies with each and every one of us...

 Q>> Our time in the First has been a never-ending succession of trials, as arduous as our path in the Source ever was.

 Q>> Yet through all our journeys together--through that deep and foreboding wood--you have helped me to stay true to my convictions.

 Q>> Thus would I return the favor. Do as your heart decrees, without hesitation or regret. And that is all I will say on the matter.

 Q>> I reasoned that Emet-Selch would not harm the Exarch until he had learned the tower's secrets, but his parting words suggest otherwise.

 Q>> Let us make haste. Your friend may not have the luxury of decades to wait for you this time.

 Q>> I knew the Night's Blessed were amongst the revelers, aye... But the Crystarium was so crowded, I thought it safe to speak my true name.

 Q>> Poor Runar and his ilk were gripped with panic. As you may recall, 'tis customary not to reveal one's true name outside of family and ceremony...

 Q>> Yet when I hurried to explain that all present were like family, I was greeted with an outpouring of tears. <sigh> An emotional people, the Blessed...

 Q>> A mage of surpassing skill living a life of seclusion. Now where have I heard that before? One can only hope they are more receptive to unsolicited visitations.

 Q>> He said the palace is on the opposite shore, but I see nothing on the horizon save empty sky. Curious...

 Q>> Actually, I believe the Exarch may have the right of it.

 Q>> They have no doubt poured a great deal of time and energy into their creations. Were I them, I should be most interested to meet with those who could overcome my defenses.

 Q>> Yes, well, you will have plenty of time to celebrate [his/her] good health *after* we've finished here.

 Q>> I can but imagine what manner of beasts keep guard here. No doubt they will afford us scant opportunity to explore the palace. A pity...

 Q>> Did you happen to notice the magicked brooms strewn about the Grand Cosmos? Uncanny.

 Q>> Then...would it be possible to force our souls into a state of dormancy, prior to transference?

 Q>> Well, I see no need for all of us to accompany you. While you escort our guest to the Inn, I will assist Urianger in creating the requisite auracite.

 Q>> Urianger is more than capable of creating the auracite on his own, but if aught should go awry, I would be on hand to assist him.

 Q>> In the course of preparing more auracite, we made a significant discovery. We thought it best to wait for your return before sharing our findings.

 Q>> Our work...did not proceed quite as expected.

 Q>> In your absence, we had a frank discussion on the principles of soul transference, and concluded at length that white auracite was ill-suited for our purposes. 

 Q>> 

 Q>> While we are thus engaged, I think it best that [WARRIOR OF LIGHT] return to the Source and inform Krile and the others of our findings.

 Q>> Beq Lugg insists we resume our work forthwith, but I grow weary at the thought... <sigh> What I would not give for a cup of tea, and perhaps a vanilla tart.

 Q>> To think we will not only have Zenos to contend with once we return, but a new Ultima Weapon as well. <sigh> Why must all of our enemies insist on returning from their graves?

 Q>> An adventurer calling themself a Warrior of Light... Why would anyone tie themselves to the legacy of individuals held in such low regard in the First?

 Q>> To be fair, they bear some responsibility for the Flood. But when the tale is told again and again over the course of a century, I am not surprised to see their roles distorted and them painted as villains.

 Q>> At that point, the truth mattered little. It would not change their lot.

 Q>> Those I spoke with at the orchard and the Rookery were quite keen to hear what we have to say. For as much hope as they have for the future, the scars of the past weigh heavy on them still.

 Q>> We were a hair's breadth from defeat when we faced Emet-Selch, and now we must contend with yet another Ascian. We must tread carefully.

 Q>> I for one would like to know why Ardbert urged the people to become Warriors of Light themselves.

 Q>> Hmmm... Then I think it time I return to the Greatwood.

 Q>> Until now, everything we have learned of the Ascians has been handed to us at their leisure.

 Q>> But that was one of Emet-Selch's unique failings. I have no reason to think Elidibus will be as forthcoming.

 Q>> Fortunately, I recently received word from Fanow that heretofore unexplored chambers have been discovered deep within the Qitana Ravel.

 Q>> Almet believes the relics within tell of a great calamity that befell an ancient civilization--that of the Ascians, perhaps. They may lead us to the truths we seek.

 Q>> I wouldn't dream of going without you.

 Q>> I fail to see why that would be necessary given that you will be accompanying me. Don't be coy--it doesn't suit you.

 Q>> The great serpent? I see you've been studying your Ronkan history. But no, I've heard nothing relating to the woods' protector. Still, should it prove relevant to what lies within, your expertise would prove invaluable.

 Q>> When you are ready, make for Fanow. Almet and her sisters will be expecting us.

 Q>> Let us pray these new ruins are not as unwelcoming as the last.

 Q>> We are grateful that you did. From what you have told me, I strongly suspect that the wisdom my comrades and I seek can be found within.

 Q>> This wisdom could prove invaluable, for we may soon face a foe whose greatest asset is our ignorance.

 Q>> Remind me: exactly how old are you and your sisters? ...On second thought, perhaps it's for the better I do not know.

 Q>> Please, you needn't apologize. As a seeker of knowledge myself, I understand full well their enthusiasm. And if not for your sedulous efforts to protect the ruins, we would not be afforded this opportunity.

 Q>> Even Emet-Selch was taken aback to find a mural illustrating the Final Days in these ruins. What other surprises do you suppose yet lie within?

 Q>> We learned nothing of the Ascians, but the potential link between the Echo and preternatural starshowers is intriguing.

 Q>> We are not deserving of such reverence, but we are grateful all the same. You can be certain we will have our own tales to tell of the great guardians of Rak'tika and the ruins of Ronka.

 Q>> Although we learned naught of the Ascians, the insight we gained into the Echo made our trip worthwhile.

 Q>> Before we return to the Crystarium, however, there is a small matter I would attend to in Slitherbough. Might I trouble you to come with me?

 Q>> Thank you. After we arrive, we should have a brief word with Runar.

 Q>> Runar appears to be in characteristically high spirits.

 Q>> I'm sorry, Runar, but we haven't the--

 Q>> <sigh> My apologies, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. It seems our return to the Crystarium will be delayed.

 Q>> But perhaps only for a bit--if you assist me with my work.

 Q>> I say â€œwork,â€� but it is rather more a chore. I must clean my chambers here in Slitherbough from top to bottom. If you would be so kind as to go and fetch a broom from Asgeir, we might finish before Runar is done cooking.

 Q>> I require a broom if I'm to make any meaningful progress here. I'm sure you can find one if you speak with Asgeir.

 Q>> I trust Asgeir was able to find a broom for us?

 Q>> Well worn. Good. This would prove difficult otherwise.

 Q>> Though I must say, I think I did rather well for not having a broom thus far.

 Q>> ...Yes, well, you weren't buried beneath a veritable avalanche of books when you entered, were you? Right. Anyway, it is time I finished cleaning with the help of that broom.

 Q>> You didn't honestly think I'd do it the old-fashioned way? That broom is more than capable of sweeping by itself. Or rather, it will be... Ahem.

 Q>> Time to rise, to swish and sweep,
A tidy chamber you must keep.
To this task you shall be bound,
Until no dust is to be found.

 Q>> In this one particular respect, I've no objections to following in Master Matoya's footsteps.

 Q>> (-Y'shtola-)In future, I may need you to remind me the pursuit of knowledge does not preclude other equally important duties... Such as maintaining clean quarters for said pursuit.

 Q>> (-Y'shtola-)<sigh> I will dearly miss this place. These people...

 Q>> Is something troubling you? You've been rather quiet.

 Q>> I see...

 Q>> Alphinaud? I thought you were following Ardbert.

 Q>> Alisaie, are you certain you should be here?

 Q>> I look forward to it.

 Q>> Alphinaud has the right of it. Let us pay visit to the Ondo.

 Q>> We should speak with Tolshs Aath first. As chieftain, he is doubtless privy to a great many secrets.

 Q>> Don't be shy, now.

 Q>> And what circumstances are these?

 Q>> Unless, of course, we were to reclaim the livers for you.

 Q>> It seems a fitting payment for vital information, does it not?

 Q>> Moreover, one could argue that by employing Bismarck to reach these depths, thereby driving back the waters, we are in part responsible for the deeds of those driven to desperate ends by the changing climes.

 Q>> I thought you might say that. You've never been one to miss an opportunity to help.

 Q>> We might...but that wouldn't discourage the benthos from stealing from the Ondo again, now would it?

 Q>> Then we will have care not to draw their attention. Shall we?

 Q>> If I were a bandit leader, I'd surely keep my spoils deep within my stronghold...

 Q>> I have a feeling that there is more to this...

 Q>> The true question, then, is what we mean to do about it. Much as I would like to proceed to the ruins without further delay, we cannot allow the benthos to carry on as they are.

 Q>> Is that so?

 Q>> Well, we can hardly fault them for that.

 Q>> Indeed.

 Q>> I doubt that this can be resolved without violence, but perhaps with a show of force we can convince them to see reason before the die is cast.

 Q>> I would rather not risk your people in the attempt. If we travel to the illuminated land, is there a way we might identify the ruins ourselves?

 Q>> I'm afraid that the dead do not speak quite so clearly. Nevertheless, we shall try not to disappoint.

 Q>> The will of the ancients... If only it were so simple.

 Q>> Oh, I certainly shall.

 Q>> Thankfully, we have an alternative. A wonderful little invention, I'm certain you'll agree.

 Q>> What sort of dealings with the Fuath, I wonder...

 Q>> ï¼ˆâ˜…æœªä½¿ç”¨ï¼�å‰Šé™¤äºˆå®šâ˜…ï¼‰

 Q>> It's a minor miracle that we accomplish anything at all, wouldn't you say?

 Q>> I take it you've finished?

 Q>> He passed not even one hundred years ago, yet the truth has slipped from history. Like so many grains of sand...

 Q>> If Bismarck requires time to prepare, might I suggest a short respite? For Urianger and Thancred, in particular.

 Q>> In that case, I leave the old men in your care. The rest of us will meet you at the Split Hull anon.

 Q>> Perhaps we ought to have clarified what Bismarck meant by â€œa short while.â€� To his mind, our whole lives might be as the blink of an eye...

 Q>> We must hope that whatever slumbers in the depths will help to shed some light upon Elidibus's recent activities.

 Q>> The device appears to activate via a form of aetherial attunement, not unlike an aetheryte. Beyond that, I can say little for certain, save that we should take this opportunity to see what other records it contains.

 Q>> No response. Confound it.

 Q>> It's possible. If the previous Elidibus perished before the Final Days, the one we know could still be a survivor of the sundering.

 Q>> And yet...something in that explanation rings false.

 Q>> I will remain for a time. I would not abandon my attempts to revive the device so soon. There is more to learn here--I can feel it.

 Q>> It has been an eventful morning--if indeed it *is* morning. I've no idea how long I was unconscious.

 Q>> Regardless, I am gratified to see that my efforts at Anyder have borne fruit. We have confirmed the nature of our foe and his plot.

 Q>> Now then, what news from the surface?

 Q>> I see. Then let us make for Eulmore at once. We have much to share with our comrades, Elidibus's parting threat not least of all.

 Q>> Ah, but forgive me. It would seem my belongings did not accompany me here. I will need to retrieve them from Anyder.

 Q>> With luck, the aetherial stream you traversed still lingers. I won't be long.

 Q>> Ahhh... Fresh air at long last. I would celebrate my return to dry land with a pot of tea--had we the luxury of time.

 Q>> But we must be prepared for Elidibus. Given what we know, it is plain he will not be deterred from his course.

 Q>> And nor would I, were I him. Not if it meant forsaking everything I loved.

 Q>> That said, I have not forgotten how Emet-Selch sought to find common ground with us, for all our misgivings.

 Q>> Ultimately, our differences were not to be bridged, of course, but one must always try. Emet-Selch understood this, and if his gesture resonated with you, perhaps you might consider reaching out to his brethren.

 Q>> Though it may all be for naught, you of all people know that there is no such thing as a foregone conclusion.

 Q>> Right--no more musing. We have taken far too long as it is.

 Q>> Our friends await us in Eulmore, yes? Let us hurry and join them.

 Q>> It appears we are fashionably late.

 Q>> Come. Our tale will not wait.

 Q>> This will be my first time meeting Master Chai in his capacity as mayor. The fellow behind him is his advisor, I take it--Wrenden.

 Q>> If we are dealing with the selfsame magick employed by the Exarch, we may safely assume that our enemies are being summoned from other worlds.

 Q>> Beyond that, all is speculation. But I would wager the fact that their summoning seems still less complete than our own has rendered them more susceptible to external influence. The suggestion to kill us, for example.

 Q>> But I am musing again. Let us away ere more of them manifest.

 Q>> Sometimes, I wish that I too had been gifted with the Echo. Then I might see what you have seen and glimpse into your heart without the need for words.

 Q>> [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. If you are ready, would you recount to us how the day unfolded?

 Q>> ...So you reached out to Elidibus at the last...and his heart was moved.

 Q>> Perhaps you did. Perhaps you did not. None can say.

 Q>> Perhaps not. Ultimately, you had no choice but to strike him down.

 Q>> I suppose you did.

 Q>> But the important thing is this: though violence proved unavoidable, you did at least come to understand your foe.

 Q>> And in knowing his hopes and dreams do we best remember him--him and his legacy.

 Q>> So long as they remain unforgotten, the love he and his brethren bore for one another and the star may yet be rewarded.

 Q>> A gift from Emet-Selch. He knew of Elidibus's plight. Foreseeing his own death, he made provisions to bring Elidibus's suffering to an end, lest his friend be left to continue the struggle alone.

 Q>> Or so I wildly speculate. It is unlikely we will ever know the truth.

 Q>> The best we can do is to remember events as they happened, no more and no less. As the Ronkans so rightly put it, â€œHistory is learned, not lived.â€�

 Q>> I daresay he is blushing in his vessel.

 Q>> Speaking of which, we should make ready for our journey. Time remains of the essence, after all.

 Q>> Needless to say, once we leave, there is no guarantee that we can return. If anyone has unfinished business, now is the time to see to it.

 Q>> I must pay a visit to Slitherbough. Let us reconvene here anon.

 Q>> And what is this? Have you come to spy on me?

 Q>> ...Does Urianger truly think me so slovenly? The nerve.

 Q>> Loath as I am to disappoint, I put my affairs in order some time ago. I've even bade my farewells.

 Q>> To everyone save Runar, that is. He's nowhere to be seen...

 Q>> Honestly, he's a boy in the body of a man... <sigh>

 Q>> *Anyway*, it is time we headed back to the Crystarium. Shall we?

 Q>> ...You still have to take the *Exarch* to Nabaath Areng? I see. Very well, you can look in on Thancred while you're about it.

 Q>> His will be a difficult farewell, and I am sure he would appreciate your support.

 Q>> The path goes through Twine. If you wait there, you are like to meet him on his way back, if not before.

 Q>> As I make my way out of the wood, I shall call to mind all that I learned during my time here. And I shall picture the day of my return.

 Q>> I know not when it will be, but mark my words, I *will* learn to traverse the rift.

 Q>> I trust the Exarch had a pleasant tour of the realm.

 Q>> In the spirit of solidarity...I bid you carry the vessels as if *your* life depended on it.

 Q>> Ah, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. Your assistance is most welcome.

 Q>> I have already spoken at length with the Brass Blades of the Rose--albeit to little avail. It would seem that the thieves took great pains to conceal their activities.

 Q>> I could go into further detail, but your time might better be spent in conversation with Fufulupa. He is the officer charged with leading the investigation, and I would only be repeating that which he related to me. If aught eluded my attention, mayhap it will not elude yours.

 Q>> ...A speeding carriage? That would seem a curious choice for thieves of such proven cunning. Yet the Amalj'aa do have a foothold in eastern Thanalan. Hmmm.

 Q>> And what of their cargo? Did they carry the crystals we seek?

 Q>> ...Thancred. Wherever have you been off to?

 Q>> ...And so we find ourselves back where we began. <sigh> What have I overlooked...?

 Q>> ...Don't ask. Suffice it to say that we had something of a situation here.

 Q>> ...That's quite enough, Papalymo.

 Q>> I keep my senses strained for signs of Ascian activity, but there is little news to be had.

 Q>> Have their schemes reached some critical step? This silence is most disturbing...

 Q>> Alisaie will succeed, I am certain of it. We need but have faith.

 Q>> As she will be at pains to remind me, I have not paid Master Matoya a visit since returning from the First. But this seems as good a time as any. Come, let us make for her cave.

 Q>> I take it you are ready to bear witness to the joyous reunion of master and pupil? Very well...

 Q>> â€œMoldy old holeâ€�...? She really must miss the place.

 Q>> That may be, but no one has set foot in there since the exodus. I dread to imagine what has become of it.

 Q>> The workshop was an unforgiving place even before the exodus, and I doubt the years of neglect have improved it.

 Q>> I was still a child when last I came here, but now I am rather more capable. Not that Master Matoya seems to have noticed. Mayhap she will when I have cleaned up the mess she left.

 Q>> My apologies, but I will rest here awhile. Go on without me.

 Q>> My apologies, but I will rest here awhile. Go on without me.

 Q>> It would seem you have had quite an eventful time in my absence. But I am fully rested now and ready for more.

 Q>> No sooner do we overcome one problem than another appears. It would all seem tediously predictable but for the endless variety of our foes. This Fandaniel sounds even more unhinged than his patron.

 Q>> I have been to see the sultana. Knowing how quick the Immortal Flames are to dispose of their tempered, I judged it best to provide them with the cure first.

 Q>> As soon as I had sufficiently recovered, I traveled to Ul'dah and delivered the porxies to Her Grace, along with detailed instructions on their use.

 Q>> Yet my visit chanced to coincide with the arrival of some troubling tidings. The Immortal Flames had been on the cusp of agreeing to a truce with the Amalj'aa when negotiations abruptly collapsed.

 Q>> The Amalj'aa claim that a number of their kind have been abducted...and that men are responsible.

 Q>> Naught is known of the perpetrators as yet. But as the Immortal Flames went about investigating the abductions, they came upon one of Fandaniel's towers.

 Q>> Then mayhap you would do the same for us.

 Q>> In that case, I shall stay and begin looking into another matter, as I promised Krile. We need not *all* attend.

 Q>> If you are curious to know what I will be doing in your absence, let us speak of it another time. At present, Krile and I have no more than a hypothesis...

 Q>> By happy coincidence, Krile and I were in the process of concluding our inquiries when news reached us of Lunar Bahamut's return. There is much to discuss, but it will have to wait.

 Q>> Strange. What primal would turn down a chance to claim new thralls?

 Q>> ...Unless it is *incapable* of doing so? Primals are not wont to serve a master, Ascian or otherwise. It may well be that Lunar Bahamut differs in some fundamental manner from those we have previously encountered.

 Q>> It was kind of her to speak with us personally. You may be certain she has no shortage of other responsibilities.

 Q>> So, the Telophoroi have constructed *buildings* capable of tempering, and primals which are not? What secrets are they hiding...?

 Q>> I know not what designs the Telophoroi have on Paglth'an, but I do know they must be stopped, for the good of the Amalj'aa and us all.

 Q>> To see the Amalj'aa fighting alongside us brought to mind the Zun of the Crystarium. I pray that our peoples can forge bonds as strong as those of our counterparts in the First.

 Q>> To see the Amalj'aa fighting alongside us brought to mind the Zun we encountered in the Crystarium. I pray that our peoples can forge bonds as strong as those of our counterparts in the First.

 Q>> Amidst this great push for peace with the beast tribes, we would do well to remember that old prejudices yet remain. It is a delicate political dance, and I do not envy the sultana her task--nor any Alliance leader.

 Q>> So the Alliance would bring all of the beast tribes into the fold at a single stroke. An ambitious plan, given the delicacy of the negotiations, but mayhap an expedient one, considering the threat we face.

 Q>> Like the city-states, every beast tribe has its factions, each with their own agenda, making peace a complex proposition. But if the Alliance can come to an understanding with their leaders, it will be for them to resolve internal politics.

 Q>> We have won over the leaders. Now the leaders must win over their own people. No small task, I grant you...but we have come a long way since first we joined with Minfilia to bring an end to summoning. A long, long way...

 Q>> Then mayhap G'raha can lend a hand as well. I shall accompany Thancred back to the Rising Stones. Between us, I daresay we should be able to provide an accurate enough account of the day's events.

 Q>> Do you see that?

 Q>> Listen well, and judge for yourself. Though I can see aetherial currents, I had not thoroughly examined those that flow through the heart of Carteneau. But now that I am here, things have become clear.

 Q>> The Flats conceal an aetheric confluence, like to the pillars of the Azim Steppe, but greater in scale. Far greater.

 Q>> The glyphs that Fandaniel has conjured reach into its very midst...

 Q>> ...And I believe I know their purpose. Should the lunar primals destroy them, it would spark a chain reaction with the potential to obliterate the confluence entirely.

 Q>> The resultant disruption to the flow of aether would sow chaos among the elements, prompting earthquakes, floods, and tempests large enough to lay waste to the realm.

 Q>> I will recommend that the Alliance keep a closer watch over Carteneau. The Telophoroi may have failed in their attempt to destroy the confluence this time, but there is naught to stop them trying again.

 Q>> A sensible division of labor. While the towers remain, so too will the threat of the lunar primals.

 Q>> And given our expertise in the field of aetherology, we are better qualified to find the solution.

 Q>> It appears we are in agreement. We have but to wait for Krile to secure the necessary permissions. In the meantime, there is a matter I would investigate.

 Q>> By strange coincidence, it does. At present, I have only a creeping suspicion, but with your help, I will soon find out whether my fears are warranted.

 Q>> If they were indeed made thralls, it seems safe to assume that these events, too, were orchestrated by the Telophoroi.

 Q>> An army of primals is awful enough, but in light of recent developments, I fear it is only the prelude to an even greater catastrophe.

 Q>> We need to devise a means to counter this threat, and quickly, before our allies are overwhelmed.

 Q>> I might have lived in Master Matoya's cave for a good part of my life, but even for me, the thought of â€œreturningâ€� to Sharlayan is quite exciting. I can hardly imagine how it is for the others who lived most of their lives there.

 Q>> You are doubtless eager to take in the sights. Not to worry, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]--the city is not like to vanish before we finish our discussion.

 Q>> You are doubtless eager to take in the sights. Not to worry, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]--the city is not like to vanish before we finish our discussion.

 Q>> I am equally untethered, as it were. There is no particular place that my kin call â€œhomeâ€�...

 Q>> Still, I would not pass up the opportunity to reacquaint myself with the city.

 Q>> The process by which Forum members are elected is fair and equitable--neither wealth nor social standing offers any advantages to a prospective candidate. But fairly elected or not, Master Matoya still found them all to be insufferable.

 Q>> I'm the last, am I? Well, my extended search of the Archon stacks produced one or two possibly useful books.

 Q>> ...But I wouldn't get your hopes up.

 Q>> If you recall, Urianger learned of the Source's reflections from *The Gerun Oracles*. For its potential to cause panic and confusion, that tome was deemed apocrypha and sealed away in the Great Gubal Library.

 Q>> 'Tis even less likely that knowledge of the unsundered world, not to mention the horrors of the Final Days, would be left sitting on a shelf for any curious scholar to find.

 Q>> It stands to reason then that my colleagues--be they Archons or councilors--should perforce be largely ignorant of the subject.

 Q>> Yet when you confronted Master Fourchenault with knowledge of the Telophoroi and their machinations, he scoffed at the suggestion that they posed a threat. He seemed adamant that the Forum would know if the Final Days were truly upon us.

 Q>> Which only supports the conclusion that whatever privileged wisdom is guiding the Forum's behavior, it is being kept secret from the rest of the nation.

 Q>> ...Not that I mean to excuse myself from reading duty. Whether they contain mention of the Final Days or no, these books could yet hold something of value.

 Q>> You weren't thinking of leaving, were you? There's plenty of work for everyone.

 Q>> Thank you for your help, but I think I can manage the rest without your assistance. If I were you, I'd steal a few quiet moments for myself...

 Q>> My loyal assistant returns! There is a lexicon on the first floor that I need you to-- Ah. You've found something, haven't you?

 Q>> It makes sense. The gleaners take their requests directly from institutions and bureaucrats, but as you say, they ultimately answer to the Forum.

 Q>> A sudden and significant increase in gleaner traffic and in cargo... It certainly gives the impression of an overarching plan being put into motion.

 Q>> How did the Forum learn of the Final Days, and exactly how much do they know? More to the point, what do they intend to do about it? Hopefully the answer to at least one of those questions lies below...

 Q>> Nay, I am not shirking my duties. I've not been down here in an age, and wished to get my bearings before I went bumbling about.

 Q>> From what I can see, however, there is naught obviously out of place. It seems we shall have to resort to discreet inquiries, as usual.

 Q>> Altogether, it gives the distinct impression that this undertaking was a sudden and unexpected development...

 Q>> Yet I find it hard to believe that such a comprehensive restructuring of Labyrinthos and its archives could have been planned in so brief a window.

 Q>> Nay, this plan was long in the making--they were but awaiting the right time to put it into effect.

 Q>> It seems likely. But let us not leap to conclusions just yet.

 Q>> For the moment, I suggest we conduct a wider investigation of Labyrinthos. The more facilities we visit, the more pieces of the puzzle we stand to find.

 Q>> This is the foremost material archive in Sharlayan. I should love to explore its treasures shelf by shelf, but I fear we have little time for such indulgences.

 Q>> This is the foremost material archive in Sharlayan. I should love to explore its treasures shelf by shelf, but I fear we have little time for such indulgences.

 Q>> Not us, then. I suppose we had better move along to another facility.

 Q>> We need to rethink our approach. Let us step outside for the moment, shall we?

 Q>> We are at an impasse. As we have no other leads, I should like to pursue this one further...

 Q>> But I doubt that our stone-faced custodian will be swayed by heartfelt pleas. We must seek another means to access the lower levels.

 Q>> 'Tis likely that the people in this area are involved in the restructuring in one way or another. If we were to ingratiate ourselves, they might allow us to accompany them on the lift.

 Q>> Let us ask around. Surely someone is in need of a few strong backs to lighten the load.

 Q>> The Medial Circuit which Erenville mentioned is the tier directly below us.

 Q>> Unlike the lowest level of Labyrinthos with its rigid security, one can usually roam the middle layer quite freely. Let us see what we might find.

 Q>> The Medial Circuit which Erenville mentioned is the tier directly below us.

 Q>> Unlike the lowest level of Labyrinthos with its rigid security, one can usually roam the middle layer quite freely. Let us see what we might find.

 Q>> That mineshaft was infested with mythrilcaps. Some sort of research project, I wonder?

 Q>> I suppose they *are* a most unusual creature. Why did they develop such long limbs when all they do is shuffle about narrow tunnels?

 Q>> I took a moment to survey the surrounding area. There are several other facilities nearby we can investigate if we fail to learn aught of value here.

 Q>> The stack of crates on the hill is going below? That sounds promising. I'll gather the others and join you there.

 Q>> Is Krile still feeling unwell? I've never seen her so distracted...

 Q>> Keep an eye on her, but keep moving, too--we cannot let our quarry slip away.

 Q>> Did you see which way Erenville went...?

 Q>> Hold a moment. I have an idea.

 Q>> If memory serves, that colossal wall-like structure is Logistikon Beta--one of Labyrinthos's climate control centers.

 Q>> It should have its own lifts, with which one could access the upper or lower tiers... Aye, if I were an agent of the Forum, it would make for a convenient meeting place...

 Q>> But even if we happen to find Erenville in the company of said agent, we cannot expect them to reveal issues of importance as we nonchalantly stroll past.

 Q>> Nay, we shall have to remain undetected.

 Q>> Oh, but there are other ways of turning â€œinvisible.â€�

 Q>> Hippity hop, my little toads!

 Q>> Unaccustomed to transfiguration? Worry not. It will wear off with the passage of time.

 Q>> I suggest you and your green companions hop along and catch up with Erenville. Should you feel the magicks fading, return to me and I will refresh the enchantment.

 Q>> Wait here with me. In your current state of mind, you'd be as likely to leap into the jaws of a predator as you would learn anything of note.

 Q>> Which reminds me: ware the creatures hereabouts. In that form, you are essentially defenseless.

 Q>> Stand still, and I shall recast the spell. The transformation *should* last long enough to allow you to find and spy upon Erenville.

 Q>> You've come back alone? Where are your warty companions?

 Q>> You've come back alone? Where are your warty companions?

 Q>> Welcome back. I trust you found Erenville, then?

 Q>> Interesting... I had a feeling you would learn something important--even if that something was simply a confirmation that no one knows much of anything.

 Q>> We should share this with Krile, then discuss how we'd like to proceed.

 Q>> Assuming we find her back at the farm. She was still behaving oddly, so I bade her return and rest there...

 Q>> Perhaps not the best decision, in hindsight. Would you mind checking near those flowers she was so entranced by? The rest of us can survey the more distant areas, just in case she decided to wander.

 Q>> Well, at least we've been allowed to remain in the city.

 Q>> And our endless investigations have not been in vain--we now know that this mysterious duty of theirs began with whatever the Forum discovered in the aetherial sea.

 Q>> With our freedoms so sorely curtailed, however, we will struggle to learn aught more of substance here in Sharlayan...

 Q>> We shall have to think very carefully about how we are to proceed from here.

 Q>> The timing couldn't be better. As matters stand, we shan't be going anywhere until we discuss matters with Thancred's group and reconsider our options.

 Q>> Go, visit your home. We will be back at the annex when you are ready to rejoin us.

 Q>> If everyone is amenable to it, let us review the strategy for good measure.

 Q>> As previously agreed, we will divide into two groups.

 Q>> [WARRIOR OF LIGHT] and [his/her] band will break through the tower's defenses and locate its core.

 Q>> Meanwhile, the rest of us will tend to the prisoners, who will doubtless want for healing due to the duress of repeated summonings.

 Q>> Lest you worry, I've not forgotten my healing spells.

 Q>> Be it restoration or destruction, this sorceress can command whatever magicks the situation requires.

 Q>> Excellent. You're in time to hear the latest good news.

 Q>> Besides the delegates assembled here, the Amalj'aa and several other tribes offered to send troops of their own.

 Q>> Unfortunately, due to their physiology, many would struggle simply to survive in the harsh climate of Ilsabard. They would also likely prove tempting targets for abduction by the Telophoroi...

 Q>> All things considered, they can better aid the cause by bolstering our defenses in Eorzea--though their eagerness to do more has been noted.

 Q>> We few shall have to suffice. Ere we embark, we must distribute the warding scales to our comrades. Care to do the honors?

 Q>> I suspect a few of our comrades will be rather pleased to speak with you again, which is why I thought you'd be the ideal candidate.

 Q>> In the meantime, I have a bone to pick with Thancred and Urianger regarding their wagging tongues...

 Q>> It's something of a constant refrain that we require warmer clothing. My present garb may be lacking, fur collar notwithstanding...

 Q>> Hmm... Not to put too fine a point on it, but I wouldn't be seen dead in one of those ridiculous overcoats. If only I had time to find something to my liking...

 Q>> Oh, why not. You can keep Krile company in the Baldesion Annex.

 Q>> Sorry, I'm feeling...rather unwell.

 Q>> A meeting? Yes, I'll make my way over once my head has cleared.

 Q>> In truth, I've been feeling out of sorts since we arrived. The air is thick with a palpable aura of malevolence...

 Q>> 'Tis the monstrous tower on the horizon. Jagged, hideous, unholy... Even at this distance, its presence is overwhelming.

 Q>> Much like the sensation I felt in the Tower of Zot, only far more terrifying. Aether flows unceasingly towards it, converging into a swirling mass of unfathomable power.

 Q>> ...For a blessing, the constant chill in the air is helping to anchor my senses in the here and now. Tell the others I shall be with you in a few moments.

 Q>> Treatment of the tempered is proceeding as well as can be expected. If there is anything to report, you will be sure to know, though I gather you have a report of your own to deliver...

 Q>> I worry they were not in the best state of mind to volunteer for this undertaking, but what's done is done. I know you will take good care of them--and yourself as well, I trust.

 Q>> Welcome back. I hope they haven't been working you *too* hard...

 Q>> I see that you're still standing. Might I convince you to sit down? ...No, I thought not.

 Q>> Yes, yes, I have been taking proper breaks and imbibing sufficient water. But what of the Warrior of Light? You and the twins have an established history of reckless disregard for your own well-being.

 Q>> We're all fortunate that none of you landed yourselves in my care. I've already quite enough to deal with, between the tempered and the Ist's wounded.

 Q>> Alas, though I can mend their bodies, the toll their experiences have taken on their hearts and minds is another matter altogether.

 Q>> For their sakes, we mustn't waver--but nor must we rush ahead in eagerness to see the day won, and in so doing invite disaster...

 Q>> Hm, yes...'tis still you...

 Q>> My apologies--I realized too late that the aether emanating from the tower was distorting my perception. 'Twas likely a temporary effect, but I remain wary.

 Q>> Hm, yes...'tis still you...

 Q>> My apologies--I realized too late that the aether emanating from the tower was distorting my perception. 'Twas likely a temporary effect, but I remain wary.

 Q>> It seems not. More to the point, we can surmise that wave of aether issued not from the Tower of Babil, but from the primal lurking within it...

 Q>> A primal whose cry rang rather more loudly in your ears than ours.

 Q>> If you were taken to the tower itself, then this proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is the beating heart of the Telophoroi's machinations.

 Q>> How quickly can we enact this plan?

 Q>> Fandaniel made it quite clear that haste is a priority.

 Q>> As ever, we are grateful for your foresight.

 Q>> This is the moment we've been waiting for. Spare no effort in your preparations.

 Q>> As do we.

 Q>> Yes, free of unnecessary encumbrances, if rather more susceptible to the cold. Let us review our strategy--quickly, if you don't mind.

 Q>> Fear not--no serious wounds have gone untreated. Nor will I stand for being left behind while the rest of you rush headlong into danger, so you needn't bother suggesting it.

 Q>> Assuming Fandaniel intends to make Zodiark serve as a catalyst for the Final Days...

 Q>> One cannot but wonder if he willingly parted ways with the other Ascians long ago.

 Q>> Surely they would not have permitted the very god they created to forestall the world's end to be used in such a way.

 Q>> She channeled a dangerous amount of aether. And that's to say nothing of the teleportation magick she must have used to get here.

 Q>> Yet Krile and Hydaelyn both were clearly willing to take the risk. Hmm.

 Q>> I'm the last person who should be scolding others for using dangerous teleportation magicks. But if that is indeed how Krile reached us in time, I do wish Hydaelyn had taken a little more care...

 Q>> Regardless, 'tis nothing Urianger and I cannot put right.

 Q>> Thank goodness you are unharmed.

 Q>> We did what we could to subdue the tempered before making our way here.

 Q>> Not without casualties, unfortunately. Some few detonated explosives, killing themselves and others.

 Q>> The contingent's healers had their hands full tending to the injured and enthralled when we took our leave.

 Q>> As for Alphinaud and Alisaie, they insisted on remaining in Garlemald while we three rushed to your aid. It appears, however, that matters here have already come to a conclusion...

 Q>> But what manner of conclusion, if I might ask? And is this the ally whom Hydaelyn bade you seek out? He is not unlike the shades of Amaurot.

 Q>> Then Zodiark is no more!?

 Q>> Please do. You need not exert yourself on our account.

 Q>> These crystals contain records of your time here, yes? May we peruse them while we wait?

 Q>> I shall leave that to you, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT], while I see what can be gleaned from the crystals on these lower levels.

 Q>> Pray review the records on the upper floor, and I will see if there is aught to be learned down here.

 Q>> Did you learn anything of import?

 Q>> So it is as we suspected. Maintaining the brands requires a great deal of Her energy and focus--and this cost has grown higher with every Rejoining.

 Q>> That would explain why contact with Her has become rather infrequent since the Seventh Umbral Calamity.

 Q>> I too made a rather startling discovery...

 Q>> This heavenly body we know to be the moon was in fact created by Hydaelyn!

 Q>> When the watcher said he was created together with this place, I thought he only meant this facility... Truly, Hydaelyn's powers are far beyond anything I could have imagined.

 Q>> It may be true, but others will struggle to believe it. I can scarcely believe it myself.

 Q>> If he labors in service to Hydaelyn's plan, I see no reason not to do as he suggests. Shall we make for this Crushing Brand, then?

 Q>> So close and yet so far. Does not the harsh terrain remind you of somewhere we've been before? The Dravanian forelands, aye.

 Q>> A place that rejects the intrusion of outsiders. Where solitude reigns supreme... At the very least, it sounds suitable for Zodiark's prison.

 Q>> This entire cave is thrumming with ambient aether...

 Q>> Alas, any further analysis will have to wait.

 Q>> Unexpected, but greatly appreciated.

 Q>> I believe we are all ready.

 Q>> Dalamud has long been described as the â€œloyal houndâ€� of Menphina due to its relation to the greater moon...

 Q>> It seems highly improbable--if not impossible--for ancient peoples to have known of Argos, but now I wonder whether there is some connection...

 Q>> Our ally's assurances notwithstanding, we cannot be certain what awaits us on the other side, so perhaps it would be best if we did not all go at once. I propose the two of us cross first while Thancred and Urianger wait here.

 Q>> Onward!

 Q>> A malefic aether yet permeates from the crater. Remnants of Zodiark, most like.

 Q>> Just a little further...

 Q>> This structure is enormous...though that is hardly surprising given the size of the average Amaurotine.

 Q>> Right, then. Let us head inside and...oh?

 Q>> If Argos is to remain without, let us not keep him waiting overlong.

 Q>> Its scale is reminiscent of Amaurot, or rather, the replica we visited on the First.

 Q>> I find Urianger's reasoning somewhat flimsy, but the crew seems amicable enough.

 Q>> Such a fascinating apparatus, though it's hard to believe it could house so many crew members. Even so, there is nothing else here to suggest other types of accommodation.

 Q>> The aetheric composition and density of this sphere is quite similar to the crystalline concepts we've seen before. It likely shares their capacity for storing memories and knowledge.

 Q>> I should have realized something was amiss when Livingway referred to us as children. What other delightful misconceptions do they hold, I wonder.

 Q>> She does not want for enthusiasm. The notion of Etheirys rotting to its core being a matter of course is rather concerning, though.

 Q>> Nevertheless, let us take this opportunity to learn more of the Loporrits and this vessel.

 Q>> Given their earlier confusion regarding our size, I cannot help but wonder if they even know the first thing about us...

 Q>> I take it you too had a wide assortment of carrots to choose from and naught else?

 Q>> If I may ask, what exactly did these collaborators share with you about cuisine on Etheirys? Surely you are aware we have an abundance of dishes and foods you could emulate?

 Q>> I hope our critiques, such as they are, were helpful to you.

 Q>> Though if you should decide to preserve flora and fauna from Etheirys as well, you would be able to offer the passengers a more balanced diet.

 Q>> Until such a day--one I pray comes sooner than later--it would appear there is naught but carrots on the menu.

 Q>> While I'm sure the Loporrits would hop at the chance to expound upon carrots in exhaustive detail, perhaps it's time we moved on?

 Q>> Do you suppose the clothes they prepared will be as grossly oversized as the carrots?

 Q>> My, how resourceful.

 Q>> They insisted we sample *all* of their concepts ere we returned.

 Q>> Please, you mustn't be so hard on yourself. Should we resort to evacuating the people of Etheirys, they will most certainly have need of your attire.

 Q>> 'Tis clear you spared no effort in addressing our needs, but you must understand that we are not quite so...homogenous.

 Q>> Speaking for myself, what I wear now better suits my tastes, even if it is of inferior make.

 Q>> But there are others whose choices may be influenced by traditions or personal experience. Rather than make assumptions for the whole, you must consider the individual and their potential preferences.

 Q>> Livingway, might we have leave to explore Bestways Burrow unattended? You have given us much to think about.

 Q>> Until later, then.

 Q>> There you are.

 Q>> Before we arrived, you seemed to be in the midst of a rousing conversation with your guide. Did you learn anything of import?

 Q>> It remains to be seen if the people can be persuaded to evacuate when there are yet no signs of the Final Days.

 Q>> What's more, the technology of this place defies imagination. I doubt there are many who would readily come to terms with living in such surroundings.

 Q>> Indeed. Even if faced with annihilation, the decision to forsake all one knows cannot be made lightly.

 Q>> 'Tis clear now that difficult decisions lie ahead of us.

 Q>> Preparation for the evacuation of Etheirys is indeed crucial, but I am not yet willing to forsake our world and its reflections--and I trust I am not alone in my reticence.

 Q>> The Final Days will make brave fools of us all.

 Q>> Urianger usually puts more effort into concealing his clandestine endeavors. Or perhaps he's simply given up on trying to hide it, knowing we'll find out eventually.

 Q>> In any case, that he acts with good intentions is plain. So please, give him the benefit of the doubt.

 Q>> Oh, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. We thought you would be away for far longer.

 Q>> A dire emergency? I said no such thing.

 Q>> But as you are here, I could use your assistance with one small matter.

 Q>> Runningway, a companion of Growingway's, apparently has much to tell us of the Final Days.

 Q>> The problem, however, is that he is determined to live up to his name, refusing to stay still long enough for us to hold a conversation.

 Q>> Crude, but if it proves effective... He was here in Greatest Endsvale when last I saw him. Let us split up and find him.

 Q>> I could find neither hide nor...hair of him. How did you fare?

 Q>> So, he knows no more than the others.

 Q>> Care to explain yourself, Growingway?

 Q>> I am beginning to grow tired of these games.

 Q>> I suspect the Loporrits are up to something, but if there is aught to be learned of the Final Days, I think it best we play along. For now, at least.

 Q>> What other knowledge do you suppose we could glean from their archives?

 Q>> Growingway, enough.

 Q>> If you have naught else to tell us of the Final Days, you need only say so. We can ill afford to be wasting time here, as you well know.

 Q>> Did you yourselves not tell us we must act quickly?

 Q>> I fear you've misjudged us, Growingway. Never have we decried the notion of using the moon as a means of escape.

 Q>> That said, my heart breaks at the thought of abandoning Etheirys and her reflections to their doom. If there is a way to avert the Final Days, I wish to find it. We all do.

 Q>> We may fail, but our efforts would never be at the expense of your plans.

 Q>> Agreed. Let us reconvene where Argos awaits outside.

 Q>> Good. You're here.

 Q>> We must hurry to the Watcher's Palace and find Urianger.

 Q>> The Loporrits think so highly of the people of Etheirys, yet it seems this evacuation plan is the only way they know to express their adoration.

 Q>> If we had been more clear in our intentions from the start, mayhap we could have avoided this wrinkle...

 Q>> Something to keep in mind in future.

 Q>> With the Loporrits in Urianger's capable hands, we needn't worry about affairs here in our absence.

 Q>> Knowing now the face of their â€œearthly collaborators,â€� there is much to discuss with Alphinaud and the others.

 Q>> Let us return to the Tower of Babil. Our battle for the star will soon begin in earnest, and we must be prepared.

 Q>> I'd forgotten how cold it was here in Garlemald. A testament to the Loporrits' ingenuity that I felt no such discomfort on the moon.

 Q>> I share your curiosity, but warning our allies of the Final Days is of greater importance.

 Q>> I speak not only of the contingent, of course. The heads of state of every nation must know what we have learned.

 Q>> We know not when or where or in what manner the Final Days will begin to manifest, and so we must see that everyone is prepared.

 Q>> Will all the tempered be relocated?

 Q>> Master Matoya is no doubt thrilled the mother porxie affords her so many visitors.

 Q>> There is still much we do not know, but the Alliance leaders must be told. Would you be willing to contact them in our stead?

 Q>> Thank you. I look forward to seeing them both upon our return.

 Q>> Fandaniel is no more, and now his own people turn against him. It seems he's naught but his bloodlust to keep him company.

 Q>> Not at all. We understand you've been quite busy.

 Q>> Unfortunately, we have no answers at present.

 Q>> If the celestial currents have grown stagnant, as was the case in the time of Amaurot, the solution would be to alter the flow of aether throughout the entirety of the star.

 Q>> The ancients accomplished this by summoning Zodiark, sacrificing half the star's population in the doing. But it should go without saying that such a sacrifice must not--cannot--be repeated.

 Q>> Which leaves us with the daunting task of identifying the underlying catalyst for the Final Days, a feat which even the Amaurotines could not accomplish.

 Q>> Unfortunately, we found no clues in Mare Lamentorum.

 Q>> Perhaps we should start with the Forum, then. Having worked with the Loporrits in secret all this time, there is surely more they can tell us.

 Q>> In ancient times, the phenomenon was first observed in places where the celestial currents had grown weakest. 'Twould seem there is a stagnancy of aether in the skies above Radzâ€“atâ€“Han unbeknownst even to Vrtra.

 Q>> I shall survey the environs closely as we go about our search. There may be some clue as to how we can combat this phenomenon.

 Q>> Worry not. I can see your aether, and that of our companions. We have not suffered the fate of those unfortunate souls.

 Q>> Worry not. I can see your aether, and that of our companions. We have not suffered the fate of those unfortunate souls.

 Q>> Welcome back, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. Alphinaud told me everything.

 Q>> I was pleased to hear that Vrtra has chosen to reveal himself at last. The people of Radzâ€“atâ€“Han need a strong and wise satrap more than ever.

 Q>> Even were Vrtra to acquiesce to their proposal, just how do the Sharlayans intend to transport the nation's entire populace to the moon?

 Q>> Even were Vrtra to acquiesce to their proposal, just how do the Sharlayans intend to transport the nation's entire populace to the moon?

 Q>> Good you could join us. Mihleel over there will be happy to take your order.

 Q>> Welcome back. Whatever did the Radiant want with you, pray tell?

 Q>> Our allies have sent military delegates? That's news to me. Mind sharing the details?

 Q>> If the Forum truly has been spurred to action by Hydaelyn's prophecy, then is it not odd that the Antitower was entrusted to Master Matoya, who bears them no love?

 Q>> No doubt She has a reason for this, and I would know what it is...

 Q>> If the Forum truly has been spurred to action by Hydaelyn's prophecy, then is it not odd that the Antitower was entrusted to Master Matoya, who bears them no love?

 Q>> No doubt She has a reason for this, and I would know what it is...

 Q>> Krile tells us you have obtained new knowledge that may aid us in our ongoing efforts.

 Q>> I've news to share regarding our study of the aetherial sea, but your findings are certain to be of greater interest, and so I would rather hear them first.

 Q>> To what revelations did Hydaelyn's Elpis flower lead?

 Q>> You make it sound so simple...but you're not wrong.

 Q>> Vanquish Meteion and we deliver the world from the Final Days. But to even attempt it, there are two conditions.

 Q>> First, we must determine her location.

 Q>> Before Meteion escaped, an enchantment was placed upon her by Venat. The woman who would become Hydaelyn.

 Q>> The implications of temporal magicks are not entirely understood, and so we cannot assume that our Hydaelyn and the Venat you met in Elpis are one and the same. Nevertheless, due to Her intrinsic qualities as an all-powerful being, I'd wager that Hydaelyn possesses the knowledge we seek.

 Q>> Whether She would share that knowledge with us, however, remains to be seen.

 Q>> After all, She intends for us to flee Etheirys, not to stay.

 Q>> We must find a means to reach Meteion.

 Q>> Naturally, our chosen method will depend entirely upon wheresoever she has made her nest.

 Q>> Sadly not. Though we enlisted the help of Arenvald and other Echo-blessed allies, we couldn't detect so much as a whisper from Hydaelyn, even from within the Antitower.

 Q>> Master Matoya is of the opinion that in the years since abandoning it, the Forum has found some other method of receiving instructions from Hydaelyn.

 Q>> If so, it would most likely be some form of apparatus for observing the aetherial sea, built closer to home.

 Q>> Master Matoya has suspected for some time that the Forum has been constructing a new facility for the purpose of surveying the aetherial sea.

 Q>> Of course, as the custodian of the Antitower, which would presumably be rendered obsolete as a result, she has a few things to say about that. Nothing that should be repeated in polite company, you understand.

 Q>> I'm a little vexed that we've yet to learn of the Forum's replacement for the Antitower, though I expect that in time, they'll share that too with us--and with Master Matoya, if they've any sense.

 Q>> I'm a little vexed that we've yet to learn of the Forum's replacement for the Antitower, though I expect that in time, they'll share that too with us--and with Master Matoya, if they've any sense.

 Q>> That we have been granted permission to enter the lower levels is proof of our increased standing. Would that they had been willing to confide in us sooner...

 Q>> 

 Q>> I imagine the secrets kept here would be of great benefit to mine own research, but I will refrain from indulging my curiosity for the time being.

 Q>> While many of the facilities within the Central Circuit seem to be visible from the upper levels, the more secretive work must be carried out behind closed doors.

 Q>> I'm confident that even the deadliest of Allagan defense mechanisms are no match for our allies.

 Q>> At this rate, some of them might soon have as many accomplishments to their names as a certain Warrior of Light.

 Q>> I'm confident that even the deadliest of Allagan defense mechanisms are no match for our allies.

 Q>> At this rate, some of them might soon have as many accomplishments to their names as a certain Warrior of Light.

 Q>> What a quaint little settlement this is. A shame it is hidden underground.

 Q>> Lyse sent a letter along with Gridania's contribution. It seems she traveled there to aid in their adamantite recovery.

 Q>> Evidently, journeying to Gridania was quite the trial. As was getting into the Dalamud shard. As was reaching its depths...

 Q>> I suspect she will have few kind words to say about the Allagans when next we meet.

 Q>> We must learn of Hydaelyn's greater plan. We can only hope that She also knows the current location of Meteion...

 Q>> ...And we can do neither if we do not focus on whatever trial awaits us within.

 Q>> We must learn of Hydaelyn's greater plan. We can only hope that She also knows the current location of Meteion...

 Q>> ...And we can do neither if we do not focus on whatever trial awaits us within.

 Q>> The aether here is more brilliant than I have ever seen.

 Q>> And you communicate with Her through this device?

 Q>> I now understand why these facilities are so heavily guarded.

 Q>> If it fell into the wrong hands, the wisdom of Hydaelyn could be dangerous, 'tis true...

 Q>> However, that danger is naught compared to what would result should the commonfolk en masse venture into the aetherial sea unprepared--which they most certainly would, if they thought it would allow them to speak to the dead!

 Q>> Once *that* secret got out, no rational argument could dissuade people from wanting to see their loved ones, no matter how ephemeral the meeting.

 Q>> From the ruins of a sundered paradise did She rise, to grant this star new life.

 Q>> As its will, long has She labored to guide Her children.

 Q>> Make no mistake--this trial puts to proof Hydaelyn's own faith.

 Q>> Far be it from me to refute Hydaelyn's own words... Yet even if Her actions were neither kind nor just, we can yet give them a nobler meaning.

 Q>> We can make Her faith the salvation of mankind.

 Q>> Hydaelyn--the heart of this star--is gone... And yet, on the morrow, the sun will rise, and life will go on.

 Q>> When I look upon Sharlayan and its idyllic surrounds, there are moments when Her absence feels unreal. As do the Final Days. Would that it were so...

 Q>> Indeed... How then are we to reach it?

 Q>> 'Twould seem there is naught to do but rest and prepare. Shall we?

 Q>> I should very much like to speak with the Loporrits once their work is complete.

 Q>> 'Tis plain Hydaelyn has entrusted them with a great deal of knowledge, and I suspect there is more they could teach us.

 Q>> Quite, though it is difficult to conceive of how one can best prepare to brave a domain where dynamis governs all.

 Q>> Nevertheless, Hydaelyn deemed us worthy of the trials that await.

 Q>> For lack of any other feasible options at this late stage...let us trust in Her judgment and face Meteion as we are.

 Q>> Try as she might, Tataru had no chance of standing between you and a hearty meal. Don't worry, we saved some for you.

 Q>> Leaving so soon? I suppose it's for the best...if you'd rather not explore the bottom of a bottle with Urianger.

 Q>> I daresay the others would welcome your company as well. If you can find them, that is.

 Q>> In any case, as long as you make the most of your time, then that is all that matters.

 Q>> We will remain here a while longer. At the very least, until Urianger finds his legs again.

 Q>> This is the pinnacle of aetherochemistry. A synthesis of modern innovation and the ancient wisdom of Allag. The ark's engine appears to be capable of processing condensed aether in quantities I never thought possible.

 Q>> Primal summoning...as it was intended... I never dared to consider they could be invoked without the danger of tempering.

 Q>> Change has come quickly to this star, and greater change yet awaits in the days to come. All the more reason we must not fail.

 Q>> We were clearly no match for Meteion, yet we survived unscathed. But how...?

 Q>> We were clearly no match for Meteion, yet we survived unscathed. But how...?

 Q>> There is a structure here in front of me, yes? A tower of some sort, partially melted? Hmm. In a strange twist of fate, it seems our perception of this place is not so different as it would be elsewhere.

 Q>> The world as I used to see it... It feels as though I am dreaming while awake. This is more than the faded memory Meteion led us to believe.

 Q>> Before we jump to any conclusions, perhaps we should search elsewhere.

 Q>> My sight may have been restored after a fashion, but I fear what I see cannot be trusted...

 Q>> It's as if Meteion herself has etched these images upon my heart. I doubt not that such a feat is within her power, given that she constructed this sanctuary herself.

 Q>> His will was strong enough to reshape Ultima Thule that we might survive. That I might see again. His sacrifice must not be wasted.

 Q>> We would hear what the dragons had to share with you. Even if it's no different from what they told Urianger, it would have value.

 Q>> At present, aye. If it is indeed emotion that governs this island, perhaps it is not Meteion's, but the dragons' that holds us here.

 Q>> They tire of conflict, and have chosen a path of oblivion to escape it.

 Q>> Or rather, they have chosen no path at all. Meaning there is no way for the dragons, or anyone here on this island, to advance.

 Q>> Mayhap persuasion is not the answer.

 Q>> Meteion meant to unmake us then and there on the *Ragnarok*, and she would have succeeded if not for Thancred's determination.

 Q>> She conceded it was strong enough to overpower the despair that otherwise rules Ultima Thule, and reshape it to a degree. Perhaps it can be done again in like manner--by overpowering the prevailing emotions.

 Q>> Must this always be the price paid for safe passage?

 Q>> Alisaie is right. We must press on. For their sake...

 Q>> Though it pains me to say it, we can ill afford to stop and grieve our comrades' passing. No, there will be time enough after.

 Q>> If you were worried about my vision, you needn't be. I can still see quite well.

 Q>> I cannot say I recognize it either.

 Q>> We have encountered beings that communicate intermittently through thought, but never one that is wholly without voice.

 Q>> I presume we are having this conversation via the medium of aether. Or dynamis, as this space is suffused with vast quantities of it. Fascinating in either case.

 Q>> We should very much like to hear more of your plans. In exchange, we will answer any questions you have to the best of our ability.

 Q>> Even so, we mustn't forget their aim is oblivion, much like the dragons.

 Q>> Though I fail to see why a civilization so seemingly advanced would choose to unmake all they have created.

 Q>> At any rate, we will find no answers dallying here. Let us be on our way.

 Q>> I should not be surprised their concept of a village is so different from ours, and yet...

 Q>> You say they remain idle, but what of your work to regain corporeal bodies?

 Q>> Is it not strange they lack passion to research that which they desire above all else?

 Q>> If we are fortunate, the Ea residing in these crystals will shed light on this contradiction.

 Q>> Is it not strange they lack passion to research that which they allegedly desire?

 Q>> If we are fortunate, the Ea residing in these crystals will shed light on this contradiction.

 Q>> If it is as I suspect, then this so-called feast...

 Q>> ...Actually, let us just see it for ourselves. Fear not--we are not like to come to harm.

 Q>> Just as I had suspected. As meticulously as one might recreate the Ea's home world, this is Ultima Thule. One cannot simply generate aether here.

 Q>> As recreations, our friends are oblivious to this fact. To the very truth of their existence. Much like the phantoms of the recreated Amaurot.

 Q>> However appearances may seem, we must ever be mindful that it is the memories of the dead with whom we deal.

 Q>> Alas, we couldn't absorb it. A deficiency in our forms, it would seem.

 Q>> And did you find the answers you sought?

 Q>> A fundamental truth...

 Q>> We will hear it, of course. Let us learn what has led such an enlightened people to this indolent end.

 Q>> Before we hear the climax of the Ea's tale, mayhap I should speak of...

 Q>> ...On second thought, it would only be a distraction. We will talk more when the time is right.

 Q>> I know not what mischief you are plotting, Urianger...but I trust you have our best interests at heart.

 Q>> The rest of us shall go on ahead to Elegeia. Lest you worry, we won't start without you.

 Q>> Go on and assist Urianger with his mysterious task. We shall wait for you.

 Q>> It seems everyone is accounted for. Shall we, then?

 Q>> As Alphinaud says, everyone's resolve is beyond doubt. Yet ere we set forth, there is a thought to which I must give voice.

 Q>> While you were in Elpis, I understand that people assumed you were a familiar.

 Q>> In contrast, those phantoms we encountered in the recreated Amaurot regarded us as children.

 Q>> As people, albeit naive and immature.

 Q>> The discrepancy, I posit, is a reflection of their creator's perspective. Having spent eons among sundered men, perhaps he came to acknowledge us, even if only subconsciously.

 Q>> With Emet-Selch gone, we may never learn the truth. But I will not suffer this and countless other mysteries to go unsolved. Our journey will not end this day.

 Q>> Oh, are we saying our farewells, too? I hadn't, at present, planned on a journey of any great length...

 Q>> ...Not that I am averse to a moment or two of quiet reminiscence.

 Q>> In fact, there was something I'd been meaning to ask you--something that has been in my thoughts since the last flames of the Final Days subsided.

 Q>> During our travels, we have witnessed more than a lifetime's worth of oddities and spectacles. More than can be easily recalled or remembered...

 Q>> And nestled amongst those memories are certain essential facts--the history of Etheirys and the ancients; glimpses of the Ea--of their culture and philosophy.

 Q>> Rather than simply hoard such treasures in my mind, I wonder if I should not be disseminating them in formal records for wider consumption.

 Q>> When needed, I have penned reports and prepared briefings... But ever have I balked at the idea of binding the subject of my studies in a book or tablet.

 Q>> Truth is given shape in interpretation. When we seek to capture it with our words, it is invariably molded to fit a narrative--no matter how well-intentioned the rendering.

 Q>> An event is described as â€œsad.â€� A summation which fails to express the emotional complexity. Yet the word on the page is what endures. A pale shadow of reality.

 Q>> Throughout history, some have deliberately embellished the truth, but I believe many--if not most--deviations are the result of similar linguistic shortcomings, piling one upon the other, until the end result is unrecognizable from its origin.

 Q>> Which is why I fear that writing an account in my own words would be akin to diluting fine wine with water.

 Q>> Yet even with the potential for corrupted meaning, I do of course realize the importance of keeping written records. Without them, my search for wisdom would be a painful affair indeed.

 Q>> But what say you on this matter? Should I take up the quill? Reflect upon those experiences only we have shared, and seek to preserve them for posterity?

 Q>> Very well, then. I shall endeavor to pen what I can of the Ea, and the ancients, and of so many other wonders.

 Q>> But I am no scribe. It will be less a polished work, and more a reordering of scattered notes...

 Q>> Very well, then. I will refrain from publishing any formal work on the Ea, or the ancients, or on any of the wonders we encountered.

 Q>> I will, however, need to keep a few notes for future research. The passage of time can warp the truth just as surely as a poorly chosen word...

 Q>> In any case, I feel much better for having sought your opinion. Left to our own devices, we tend to overthink such things.

 Q>> I will otherwise return to following where my curiosity leads. After all, a safe method of travel to the First yet eludes me, and our venture into the great expanse has prompted an entirely new set of questions!

 Q>> Should you stumble into the unknown, or struggle with some impenetrable mystery, know that I am at your beck and call.

 Q>> It never hurts to see things from a different perspective, and mine is rather different than most!

 Q>> Lyse came to visit the other day. She peppered me with questions about the lasting repercussions of the Final Days.

 Q>> I took the opportunity to explain our plans to â€œdisband,â€� and she understood our reasoning immediately. Once a Scion, always a Scion, it would seem.

 Q>> She was eager to relive old times, and remember old friends... Bittersweet memories, mayhap, but from the look on her face, the joys outweighed the sorrows.

 Q>> I don't see Thancred anywhere. Was he not supposed to be traveling with Urianger?

 Q>> Just imagine the possibilities...

 Q>> What he means is, we are grateful for the use of one of your precious fishing vessels.

 Q>> Alzadaal III... I confess I am somewhat embarrassed that the tale of his journey to another world escaped my notice. Could it be more than simple folklore?

 Q>> I am aware that this story about an otherworldly journey may be just that--a story. But even the wildest tale often contains a few grains of truth, and that is worth investigating.

 Q>> I came here in search of something that might further my research. I did *not* anticipate a fully functioning voidgate.

 Q>> So they managed not only to expand the fissure, but also manipulate it as one might a gate...

 Q>> Astonishing. Is there any chance I could learn more of how this feat was accomplished?

 Q>> Ah, my apologies--we were perhaps a touch zealous in our rush to uncover the vault's secrets. If the constructs can be repaired, we would be happy to offer our assistance...?

 Q>> There is much about the voidgate that I cannot even begin to explain. I must convince Vrtra to share everything he knows...

 Q>> Quite a few, in fact. But I'd like to begin with the gate itself. It is still functional, yes?

 Q>> That â€œlittle doorâ€� you speak of leads to an abyss teeming with unspeakable horrors.

 Q>> That said, in its current state, it would admit only the lowliest of voidsent. And from this side, no man would be able to pass through.

 Q>> Physical size is only one consideration. The true restriction hinges upon the aetheric density of the soul in transit.

 Q>> And yet you succeeded in expanding this diminutive portal and sending your simulacrum to the Thirteenth...

 Q>> You seem to have struck a bargain of your own, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. Though it serves you well in battle, be aware that the beneficial nature of your â€œarrangementâ€� is the exception which proves the rule.

 Q>> In any case, we should attempt to gain an understanding of the Bounty gate. Mayhap you could resume the search for your sister...

 Q>> Your Excellency. Would you object if I were to conduct a closer examination of the gate? I will make no attempt to open it, of course.

 Q>> You are most gracious. I shall take full advantage of your permission.

 Q>> We can discuss my findings once I return. You'll not be rid of me so easily.

 Q>> If we're to enter Noumenon's restricted archives with a minimum of fuss, then we must secure the permission of the Forum.

 Q>> First, however, we shall need to enlist the cooperation of a member to broach the matter on our behalf. Who do you think might be inclined to assist us?

 Q>> 

 Q>> 

 Q>> 

 Q>> 

 Q>> No one springs to mind?

 Q>> Hm... What of Scholarch Montichaigne?

 Q>> He did come to G'raha's defense during the inquiry, after all.

 Q>> 'Tis settled. Let us head to Phenomenon and see if he's willing to help us once more.

 Q>> I apprenticed to Master Matoya at the age of seven, and labored under her tutelage for a full decade. I never had the chance to attend the Studium...

 Q>> Neither did Thancred, as I recall. Soon after Master Louisoix took him in off the streets, he was put in the care of another Archon. His was a rigorous and practical education in the arts of espionage and survival.

 Q>> I sometimes wonder what my life might have been like had I pursued studies here instead...

 Q>> Oh, that does sound lovely. Afternoons with friends spent sipping tea and debating theories.

 Q>> ...Still, I wouldn't give up my time with Master Matoya for the world.

 Q>> The dank cave I studied in was about as far from the bright, airy halls of academia as one could get. But it was a wondrous, magical childhood nonetheless.

 Q>> 

 Q>> Oh, never mind me. 'Twas just an idle thought.

 Q>> If I was pressed to name our allies in the Forum, Scholarch Montichaigne would certainly be at the top of the list. Hopefully he agrees to aid us with our request.

 Q>> Need to be somewhere? Very well, I will wait for you by the aetheryte.

 Q>> Oh, not to worry--I had plenty of reading to keep me occupied while you were busy. Shall we continue?

 Q>> Pray forgive the intrusion, Scholarch, but we were hoping you might help us secure permission to enter Noumenon's restricted archives.

 Q>> I would've been surprised if you had. If my assumption is correct, the research left behind by House Daemir has lain dormant in Sharlayan's archives for many centuries.

 Q>> That is, in fact, precisely what we intend.

 Q>> To develop a method of traversing the rift, for one, that I might keep my word to a distant friend.

 Q>> Sentiment aside, I have journeyed to the end of existence. I have heard, felt, and thought endlessly about the truth of our world and the echo of its future. And yet I want to understand *everything*--to unravel it all down to its very last secret.

 Q>> What scholar worthy of the name wouldn't force open a voidgate or two if a grand revelation was the promised reward?

 Q>> I was hesitant to approach him directly, but there is no denying that having Master Fourchenault on our side would tip the balance in our favor. Very well. We will pay a visit to the Leveilleur estate and plead our case.

 Q>> Of course, Scholarch. We will be sure to pass on any revelations.

 Q>> Montichaigne seemed optimistic, but I doubt convincing Fourchenault to champion our cause will be as simple as showing up on his doorstep.

 Q>> We've come to speak with Master Fourchenault. Is he home, by any chance?

 Q>> Scholarch Montichaigne expressed much the same sentiment. I assure you, we'll not attempt to circumvent the Forum's authority again...unless it is absolutely necessary, of course.

 Q>> For a brother who misses his sister. She was his guardian and his friend--a selfless hero who crossed the rift between worlds to save her homeland from horror and suffering.

 Q>> But the brother has given up on thoughts of reunion. He spends his efforts elsewhere, watching over a people yet healing from the flames of the Final Days, loyal to his duty while betraying the longing in his heart.

 Q>> 'Tis no vital mission, perhaps, reuniting these siblings. But it feels a worthy cause to pursue, all the same.

 Q>> As one who feared losing his own loved ones, and spent years in research to prevent it, surely you appreciate how painful such a separation must be.

 Q>> 

 Q>> 

 Q>> 

 Q>> The matter is out of our hands. All that remains is to return to the annex and await word of the Forum's decision.

 Q>> So. What did the Forum decide?

 Q>> That is wonderful news. Thank you both for speaking on our behalf.

 Q>> Uncompromising? Aye, but that very stoicism is exactly what Sharlayan needed to guide it through not one, but two exoduses.

 Q>> That went rather well, I think.

 Q>> As a child, I dreamed up any number of schemes for getting my hands on those forbidden tomes... And now I can simply walk in through the door.

 Q>> Our focus will be on finding House Daemir's research notes, of course, but the thought of so much knowledge at my disposal has me feeling a little giddy.

 Q>> I'd like to set out as soon as you're ready.

 Q>> You presume correctly.

 Q>> Excellent. Once again, we thank you for all your help.

 Q>> Shall we?

 Q>> To think the set of instructions I laughingly imagined may actually exist but yalms away from where you found me napping...

 Q>> If I had known of Alzadaal III's exploits sooner, I could well have saved myself days of research. Even a children's book might have pointed me in the right direction.

 Q>> To achieve the impossible, one must needs be flexible of mind and look beyond conventional wisdom. A lesson I had already learned, but clearly not taken to heart.

 Q>> Come along, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. Noumenon and its forbidden wisdom awaits.

 Q>> Very well, but please do hurry back. I shall await you at the annex.

 Q>> All set this time? No forgotten chores or errands to call you away? Good--the forbidden tomes await!

 Q>> So many books I've yet to read...

 Q>> Yes, yes, we are here for one specific volume. You needn't remind me.

 Q>> Have something you'd like to show me, do you? My apologies--I flipped open but a single book and was completely absorbed by the contents...

 Q>> Well done, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. I think you may have found our prize.

 Q>> As much as I would love to start crafting the Atomos, I'm afraid this is far outside my field of expertise.

 Q>> Fortunately, we know a Hannish alchemist who would be delighted to involve herself in our House Daemir project.

 Q>> Our business here is concluded, for the moment. Please pass on our regards to the Forum.

 Q>> If anyone can help us, Nidhana can. I say we return to Thavnair and look for her at the Great Work.

 Q>> All these sallow, sleep-deprived faces, but their eyes still burn with fiery zeal. Some things never change.

 Q>> I have no doubt you will be interested. This research log should speak for itself.

 Q>> Few should. It was sequestered in Noumenon's restricted archives, after all.

 Q>> Now that you've glanced over the notes, what say you to helping us build a new mock Atomos?

 Q>> You are a woman after my own heart.

 Q>> Then by all means, accompany us to the vault. I plan to lead us back there shortly...once we've finished gathering the components I require.

 Q>> Sharlayan's markets provided the raw aquamarine and pure water crystals...

 Q>> But I might need help obtaining a small quantity of astrally infused water.

 Q>> That sounds perfect. If you would be so kind as to fill a flask at the pool, I will petition Vrtra to join us. The idea I have in mind won't amount to much without his authority to command the voidgate.

 Q>> Shall we be about it, then? We meet back here anon.

 Q>> Do you have that flask for me?

 Q>> Yes...this should suffice. Thank you, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT].

 Q>> Look who I came across. Estinien seemed in need of diversion, and we, in turn, may have need of his lance...

 Q>> Right, then. Now that our little party is assembled, let us make our way to the ruins.

 Q>> Your Excellency is ever the gracious host. Shall we?

 Q>> Onto the boat, if you please. We can chat on the way there.

 Q>> Poor Vrtra--he really should have spoken with Estinien before we left. I shudder to think what we've cost them in terms of construct materials...

 Q>> We need to wait for a time to ensure a meaningful result. Be patient, and keep watch for any intruders.

 Q>> Once Nidhana succeeds in replicating the mock Atomos, this door into the Thirteenth will be ours to open.

 Q>> Will you be crossing the threshold alongside us? I realize this is more my endeavor than yours...

 Q>> Why does everyone insist on being so secretive? I at least had good reason for not wanting to explain my nixie ritual...

 Q>> Ahem. Shall we proceed with our other preparations, then?

 Q>> As we saw, the warding scale can be effective at protecting the bearer from other sources of aetheric corruption. Nevertheless, the talisman's durability will need to be improved if it is to withstand the void's influence for a prolonged length of time.

 Q>> And I think that is a problem we can address without involving the brilliant but busy alchemists who created it. Who do we know who excels at this kind of structural augmentation?

 Q>> An excellent suggestion.

 Q>> Perhaps they once did, but availing ourselves of Allagan insights tends to be an involved process in and of itself.

 Q>> Nay, I believe a more straightforward approach is in order: consulting with the engineers of Garlond Ironworks.

 Q>> 

 Q>> 

 Q>> What of Garlond Ironworks, then? They may have an engineer free to assist us.

 Q>> As I recall, Cid himself is no stranger to the void and its volatile energies.

 Q>> With his experienced hand at the helm, I have every confidence that the Ironworks can strengthen the warding scale.

 Q>> Come, let us visit their operation in Rhalgr's Reach and commission their best and brightest.

 Q>> Perhaps this young man can locate Cid for us.

 Q>> We have a commission for you and your president, actually. Assuming he's available...?

 Q>> And how might we achieve that?

 Q>> A suit of armor, as you said.

 Q>> Understandable. We know how busy your schedule is, and the final result will doubtless be worth the wait.

 Q>> I think we can leave the rest in Cid's capable hands. Let's return to the Great Work, and see how Nidhana is getting on with the mock Atomos.

 Q>> I hope Nidhana has good news for us.

 Q>> You surprise me, Estinien. For a lone wolf, you've shown an unusual degree of, shall we say, â€œinvolvementâ€� in helping Vrtra reach this conclusion.

 Q>> What of your own answer, then? You seemed disinclined to venture into the void...

 Q>> Indeed, but perfect for our purpose, I should think. I'd rather not bother the Scions with aught less than a dire threat to the star.

 Q>> I'd rather not bother our comrades with aught less than a dire threat to the star. We four should be sufficient for our purpose.

 Q>> With things as they are, I'd rather not bother our comrades with aught less than a dire threat to the star.

 Q>> It will make for an interesting journey besides. Traveling in a smaller party for a change--crowds can be a bit draining, don't you think?

 Q>> Now, on to specifics.

 Q>> Unlike the First, where the Flood of Light was halted before its devastation was complete, the Thirteenth has been utterly subsumed by Darkness. My plan, as such, is to explore the void in stages, withdrawing to safety after each brief foray.

 Q>> 'Twould be more convenient had we some manner of base camp nearer to the gate itself...

 Q>> Conducting our expedition out of the Rising Stones would raise just as many questions as recruiting too many Scions. At least here in Radzâ€“atâ€“Han, we might be expected to appear road-weary from our â€œlocalâ€� explorations.

 Q>> As ever, you are most gracious, Your Excellency.

 Q>> I only wish we knew more about our destination. The gods only know how long our explorations might possibly take, or what our chances of success might possibly be...

 Q>> On that note, I will return to the Great Work and lend what help I can to Nidhana. If you've preparations to make ere we venture into the Thirteenth, now is the time.

 Q>> There you are, [WARRIOR OF LIGHT].

 Q>> I present to you the fruits of the alchemists' labor: the artificial Atomos.

 Q>> Though we've yet to put it to the proof, its aether is practically identical to that of the original. A truly remarkable feat in so short a time.

 Q>> She rushed off after bringing the Atomos to attend to a pressing task, but said that she would return ere we set forth.

 Q>> Which should be shortly after our friends from the Ironworks arrive with the warding scales...

 Q>> Right on cue. 'Tis good to see you all again.

 Q>> But for the president himself to attend... Keen to bear witness to our little experiment, are you?

 Q>> For my research into cross-rift travel, this is a moment of truth. For all those who helped us come this far, let us pray we succeed.

 Q>> True to our friends' words, the warding scales are eminently reinforced. We needn't fear corruption even should we be wounded by voidsent.

 Q>> This castle should serve as a base of operations for now.

 Q>> Ere we set our sights elsewhere, let's see what there is to learn here.

 Q>> Wherever I turn, there's Darkness as far as I can perceive; the only source of Light here is ourselves. The opposite was true in the First.

 Q>> In any case, there's little exploration to be done while we are confined to this isolated isle.

 Q>> I propose we begin by learning what we can from the castle's occupants. An understanding of their ways may prove useful to our cause.

 Q>> Like the prevailing tongue in Norvrandt, the language of this world bears a resemblance to our own. It may be assumed that they share a common ancestor.

 Q>> My experience was much the same. Lower-rung voidsent tend to have lower intelligence, 'twould seem.

 Q>> What of you?

 Q>> Indeed.

 Q>> Let's take ourselves back there and find this voidsent--preferably before its fellows make a meal of it.

 Q>> There appears to be someone within...

 Q>> As much as one might expect the unexpected, I doubt any of us could have foreseen this turn of events.

 Q>> She seems different from other voidsent--at least those we've met. And the change we witnessed, I suspect, is due to your crystal purging the excess Darkness in her.

 Q>> Even so, she still harbors a great deal of Darkness. I'm very keen to hear what she can tell us--about herself and about her world.

 Q>> While the language of this world is similar to ours, it is her covenant with Zenos that should ensure we can understand one another.

 Q>> The magick for summoning voidsent also facilitates communication, you see. Without this component, a mage would struggle to make his mind known to his servant.

 Q>> Voidsent crave one thing alone: aether.

 Q>> In return for information, I offer you mine. Just not all of it, mind you. I still have need of my life.

 Q>> Then we have a bargain.

 Q>> You needn't worry for me. My life force is a small price to pay for her knowledge, and I will recover it quickly enough once we've returned home.

 Q>> No one else seems to be nearby. Perhaps it was just a trick of the wind...

 Q>> If naught is out of the ordinary, I should like to hear more from Zero. I can't imagine there are many part voidsent like her who remember the world as it was.

 Q>> You shall have it as soon as we've arrived.

 Q>> I will see to the payment, and then we may ask Zero what she knows about Azdaja.

 Q>> In light of our recent experiences, I expect we all have questions. I trust Zero can answer some few of them.

 Q>> We should still be owed at least that much, I daresay.

 Q>> From memoria to Golbez and his archfiends, we have more questions now than answers. But that is a sign that we are making progress.

 Q>> I believe we understand the fundamentals of rebirth now.

 Q>> If I may, I would ask you about your power. Will you tell us about it?

 Q>> I am told that heroes of the Thirteenth once sealed gods in stones called auracite. Are they and memoria one and the same?

 Q>> How does one come to wield memoria? And what happened to your peers?

 Q>> ...I see.

 Q>> Let us entrust the task to [WARRIOR OF LIGHT]. <If(PlayerParameter(4))>Her<Else/>His</If> Echo will help facilitate communication.

 Q>> More importantly, <If(PlayerParameter(4))>she<Else/>he</If> should be able to maintain [his/her] composure better than a concerned sibling.

 Q>> Scarmiglione, too, appeared surprised by Zero's power. As she says, it must be a lost art.

 Q>> This makes her invaluable to our cause--far more than someone who can simply communicate.

 Q>> Oh, you've finished already? Or did we get carried away talking...

 Q>> There's no easy way to mark the passage of time in this world. Nor do I imagine such things concern voidsent.

 Q>> It would take considerable mental fortitude to still care after millennia in this endless night.

 Q>> Scarmiglione's aggression is also consistent with the claims that the archfiends conquer other domains.

 Q>> By that logic, you've no reason to refuse our requests. The payment need but be to your satisfaction, correct?

 Q>> I assume you also know how we can get off this isle?

 Q>> Now that you mention it, I did notice some flying creatures near the terraces.

 Q>> Zero will best know how to handle the creatures. Let us watch and learn.

 Q>> 'Tis said that a person's domain is a reflection of what abides in their heart. If true, this place may offer a glimpse into Zero's past.

 Q>> 'Tis said that a person's domain is a reflection of what abides in their heart. If true, this place may offer a glimpse into Zero's past.

 Q>> As you may recall, when a larger voidsent is summoned, only its soul makes the journey to the Source.

 Q>> Upon its arrival, it takes possession of a host body. But during that time, what becomes of its actual body here in the Thirteenth?

 Q>> The answer to this question may give us valuable insight into cross-rift travel.

 Q>> To that end, while asking after Golbez, I shall also see what the voidsent can tell me about their experiences when summoned.

 Q>> What little I learned in your absence did not pertain to the archfiends. That discussion can wait until after we've tended to Barbariccia.

 Q>> What little I learned in your absence did not pertain to the archfiends. That discussion can wait until after we've tended to Barbariccia.

 Q>> Rest assured this won't be our last opportunity to learn about Azdaja.

 Q>> If another archfiend were to fall, Golbez would surely be compelled to respond.

 Q>> We need only wait for our quarry to come to us.

 Q>> Scarmiglione was the archfiend of earth, while Barbariccia is of the wind. In this world given to Darkness, I wonder what significance their elemental titles hold.

 Q>> Though Zero remains unconscious, she appears otherwise fine.

 Q>> ...Insofar as I can discern, at any rate. Being part voidsent, her physiology may be rather different from ours. Let us observe her for a while as we discuss our next move.

 Q>> Even those part voidsent require rest, I imagine. And her own abode seems as good a place as any.

 Q>> Unlike the Source, however, there is scant ambient aether for her to draw upon here...

 Q>> I haven't the faintest inkling, nor can I say whether the aether we can afford to share will be enough to awaken her.

 Q>> 'Twould be best to take her back with us to the Source. There, she would be guaranteed all she requires.

 Q>> Why not go and find this newcomer? So we have something to tell Zero, if nothing else.

 Q>> Worry not, we will keep an eye on Zero. Go and meet this newcomer.

 Q>> Varshahn has told all. Golbez goes to great lengths indeed to conceal his whereabouts.

 Q>> If I may excuse myself, I wish to pay a visit to the High Crucible.

 Q>> While the scales functioned admirably, it would be prudent to have them inspected for signs of degradation.

 Q>> While at the High Crucible, I spoke with the alchemists about Zero. If you require any assistance, don't hesitate to let them know. 

 Q>> We could not well stand idly by while the Horde threatens the good people of Ishgard.

 Q>> The dragons may never again have such an opportunity to strike at the Holy See. You can be certain they will not squander it, so we must be vigilant.

 Q>> 'Tis a rare opportunity to find onself confronted with so terrible a foe. Rarer still to emerge victorious. I should hope we need not contend with more of Nidhogg's champions.

 Q>> During his brief reign, Zenos ruled over the ruins of Garlemald. A stark contrast from the vibrance of Radz-at-Han. I trust Zero enjoyed it, in her own way.
